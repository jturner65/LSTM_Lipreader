# LSTM_Lipreader
LSTM Based Lipreader using President Obama's weekly addresses as a training set.

This Repo holds matlab files used to process avi files, split them into images and sound samples at 
various (user selectable) sample rates, and then take face-isolated and mouth-isolated images and use
them to train sequential learning algorithms.

This repo also holds data pertaining to estimated frame-wise caption locations for labels for each spoken
word.

The data used for this project was acquired from the weekly addresses of President Obama from 2009-2015, which 
consisted of 310 4-8 minute videos.  The data can be found here :
