00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.467
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.734
On Tuesday, America
went to the polls.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.166
And the message you sent was
clear: you voted for action,

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.033
not politics as usual.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:19.367
You elected us to focus
on your jobs, not ours.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:22.000
That's why I've invited leaders
of both parties to the White

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.166
House next week, so we can
start to build consensus around

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:28.300
challenges we can
only solve together.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.133
I also intend to
bring in business,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.000
labor and civic leaders
from around the country,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.166
from outside Washington, to get
their ideas and input as well.

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.667
At a time when our economy is
still recovering from the Great

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:44.200
Recession, our top priority
has to be jobs and growth.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.233
That's the focus of the plan
I talked about throughout

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:47.567
the campaign.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.734
It's a plan to reward businesses
that create jobs here in

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:53.500
America, and give people access
to the education and training

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.033
that those businesses
are looking for.

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:58.667
It's a plan to rebuild our
infrastructure and keep us on

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.800
the cutting edge of
innovation and clean energy.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.734
And it's a plan to reduce
our deficit in a balanced and

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.600
responsible way.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.367
This is even more important
because at the end of this year,

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:12.367
we face a series of deadlines
that require us to make major

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.867
decisions about how to
pay down our deficit --

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.767
decisions that will have a huge
impact on the economy and the

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:21.033
middle class, not only
now, but in the future.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.734
Last year, I worked with
Democrats and Republicans to cut

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.834
a trillion dollars'
worth of spending,

00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:28.734
and I intend to work with
both parties to do more.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.266
But as I said over and over
again on the campaign trail,

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.133
we can't just cut our
way to prosperity.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.200
If we're serious about
reducing the deficit,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.233
we have to combine spending
cuts with revenue --

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:41.433
and that means asking the
wealthiest Americans to pay a

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.066
little more in taxes.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:45.266
That's how we did it when
Bill Clinton was President.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.633
And that's the only way we can
afford to invest in education

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:50.800
and job training
and manufacturing --

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.800
all the ingredients of a
strong middle class and a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.800
strong economy.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.533
Already, I've put forward a
detailed plan that allows us to

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.433
make these investments while
reducing our deficit by

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:03.300
$4 trillion over
the next decade.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.200
Now, I'm open to
compromise and new ideas.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.967
But I refuse to accept any
approach that isn't balanced.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:13.533
I will not ask students or
seniors or middle-class families

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.500
to pay down the entire deficit
while people making over

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
$250,000 a year aren't asked
to pay a dime more in taxes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.166
This was a central
question in the election.

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:26.633
And on Tuesday, we found out
that the majority of Americans

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.767
agree with my approach --
Democrats, Independents,

00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:31.633
and some Republicans.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:34.000
Now we need a majority
in Congress to listen --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.467
and they should start by making
sure taxes don't go up on the

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:41.800
98% of Americans making under
$250,000 a year starting

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.567
January 1st.

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.533
This is something
we all agree on --

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.900
that taxes on middle-class
families should not go up.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.300
Congress should permanently
extend the middle-class tax cuts

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.834
right now; even as we
negotiate a broader deficit

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:56.467
reduction package.

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.800
It's a step that would give
millions of families and 97% of

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.667
small businesses the peace of
mind that will lead to new jobs

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:05.300
and faster growth.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.600
There's no reason to wait.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.633
We know there will be
differences and disagreements in

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.066
the months to come.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.867
That's part of what makes
our political system work.

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:16.533
But on Tuesday, you said
loud and clear that you won't

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:19.867
tolerate dysfunction, or
politicians who see compromise

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.533
as a dirty word.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.633
Not when so many of your
families are still struggling.

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.900
Instead, you want cooperation.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.500
You want action.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.600
That's what I plan to
deliver in my second term,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.467
and I expect to find leaders
from both parties willing

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.000
to join me.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
