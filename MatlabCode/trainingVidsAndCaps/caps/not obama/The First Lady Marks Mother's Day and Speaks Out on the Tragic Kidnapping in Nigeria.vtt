00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.500
The First Lady: Hello everyone, I'm Michelle
Obama, and on this Mother's Day weekend,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.910
I want to take a moment to honor all the mothers out there and wish you a Happy Mother's Day.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.000
 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.810
I also want to speak to you about an issue
of great significance to me as a First Lady,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.519
and more importantly, as the mother of two
young daughters.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:37.190
Like millions of people across the globe,
my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.649
over the kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian
girls from their school dormitory in the middle

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.010
of the night.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.420
This unconscionable act was committed by a
terrorist group determined to keep these girls

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.420
from getting an education -- grown men attempting
to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.610
And I want you to know that Barack has directed
our government to do everything possible to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.780
support the Nigerian government's efforts
to find these girls and bring them home.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.780
In these girls, Barack and I see our own daughters.
We see their hopes, their dreams -- and we

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.420
can only imagine the anguish their parents
are feeling right now.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.890
Many of them may have been hesitant to send
their daughters off to school, fearing that

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.610
harm might come their way.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.729
But they took that risk because they believed
in their daughters' promise and wanted to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.759
give them every opportunity to succeed.

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.409
The girls themselves also knew full well the
dangers they might encounter.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.610
Their school had recently been closed due
to terrorist threats...but these girls still

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.549
insisted on returning to take their exams.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.100
They were so determined to move to the next
level of their education...so determined to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.180
one day build careers of their own and make
their families and communities proud.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.180
And what happened in Nigeria was not an isolated
incident...it's a story we see every day

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.359
as girls around the world risk their lives
to pursue their ambitions.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.700
It's the story of girls like Malala Yousafzai
from Pakistan.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.530
Malala spoke out for girls' education in
her community...and as a result, she was shot

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.120
in the head by a Taliban gunman while on a
school bus with her classmates.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.790
But fortunately Malala survived...and when
I met her last year, I could feel her passion

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:46.790
and determination as she told me that girls'
education is still her life's mission.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.220
As Malala said in her address to the United
Nations, she said "The terrorists thought

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.870
that they would change our aims and stop our
ambitions but nothing changed in my life except

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.870
this: Weakness, fear and hopelessness died.
Strength, power and courage was born."

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.659
The courage and hope embodied by Malala and
girls like her around the world should serve

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.680
as a call to action.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.680
Because right now, more than 65 million girls
worldwide are not in school.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.970
Yet, we know that girls who are educated make
higher wages, lead healthier lives, and have

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.250
healthier families.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.250
And when more girls attend secondary school,
that boosts their country's entire economy.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.900
So education is truly a girl's best chance
for a bright future, not just for herself,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.909
but for her family and her nation.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.409
And that's true right here in the U.S. as
well...so I hope the story of these Nigerian

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:08.409
girls will serve as an inspiration for every
girl -- and boy -- in this country.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:15.599
I hope that any young people in America who
take school for granted -- any young people

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:22.729
who are slacking off or thinking of dropping
out -- I hope they will learn the story of

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:28.450
these girls and recommit themselves to their
education.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.339
These girls embody the best hope for the future
of our world...and we are committed to standing

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:41.849
up for them not just in times of tragedy or
crisis, but for the long haul.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:47.880
We are committed to giving them the opportunities
they deserve to fulfill every last bit of

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.830
their God-given potential.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:57.830
So today, let us all pray for their safe return...
let us hold their families in our hearts during

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.610
this very difficult time...and let us show
just a fraction of their courage in fighting

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.600
to give every girl on this planet the education
that is her birthright. Thank you.
