00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:09.709
The Vice President: Ladies
and gentlemen,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.645
this is Joe Biden, I'm filling
in for President Obama,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.083
while he addresses the NATO
summit in Wales.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:19.085
When the President and I
took office

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.955
in January of 2009, this nation
was in the midst

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:25.959
of the greatest economic crisis
since the great depression.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.061
Our economy had plummeted
at a rate

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:32.565
of 8% in a single quarter - part
of the fastest economic

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:36.035
decline any time in
the last half century.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:39.539
Millions of families were
falling underwater

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.475
on their homes and threatened
with foreclosure.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:44.511
The iconic American
automobile

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:46.112
industry was under siege.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:49.749
But yesterday's jobs
report was another

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.218
reminder of how
far we've come.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:55.288
We've had 54 straight
months of job creation.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:57.323
And that's the longest
streak

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:02.162
of uninterrupted job growth in
the United States' history.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:04.164
We've gone from losing 9
million

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:08.535
jobs during the financial crisis
to creating 10 million jobs.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.570
We've reduced the
unemployment rate

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.143
from 10% in October of 2009
to 6.1% today.

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:20.180
And for the first time
since the 1990s,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.484
American manufacturing is
steadily adding jobs -

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:28.188
over 700,000 since 2010.

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.690
And surveys of both
American and foreign

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.393
business leaders confirm
that America

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.396
once again is viewed as the best
place in the world

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.631
to build and invest.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.867
That's all good news.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.869
But an awful lot of middle
class Americans

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.139
are still not feeling the
effects of this recovery.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.776
Since the year 2000, Gross
Domestic Product -

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.446
our GDP - has risen by 25%.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:57.417
And productivity in
America is up by 30%.

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.586
But middle class wages
during that same

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:04.724
time period have gone up by
only fourteen cents.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.526
Folks, it's long past time

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:10.063
to cut the middle class back
into the deal, so they

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.733
can benefit from the economic
growth they helped create.

00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:15.735
Folks, there used to be a
bargain in this country

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:17.904
supported by Democrats and
Republicans,

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.572
business and labor.

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.307
The bargain was simple.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.510
If an employee contributed
to the growth

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.778
and profitability of the
company,

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.249
they got to share in the profits
and the benefits as well.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.251
That's what built
the middle class.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.253
It's time to restore the
bargain,

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.255
to deal the middle class back in.

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.524
Because, folks, when the
middle class does well,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.126
everybody does well - the
wealthy get wealthier

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.762
and the poor have a way up.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:44.764
You know, the middle
class is not a number.

00:02:44.764 --> 00:02:46.299
It's a value set.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.835
It means being able to
own your home;

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.837
raise your children in a safe
neighborhood;

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.872
send them to a good school where
if they do well

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:56.476
they can qualify to go to
college and if they get accepted

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:58.444
you'd be able to find a
way to be able

00:02:58.444 --> 00:02:59.445
to send them to college.

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:02.949
And in the meantime, if
your parents need help,

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.951
being able to take care
of them,

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.654
and hope to put aside enough
money so that your children

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.923
will not have to take care of you.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.524
That's the American dream.

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.660
That's what this
country was built on.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.829
And that's what we're
determined to restore.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.599
In order to do that, it's
time to have a fair tax

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.335
structure, one that values
paychecks

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:26.072
as much as unearned income and
inherited wealth,

00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:28.074
to take some of the burden off
of the middle class.

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.944
It's time to close tax
loopholes so we can

00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:34.080
reduce the deficit, and invest
in rebuilding America -

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.182
our bridges, our ports, our highways,

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:39.519
rails, providing good jobs.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.521
With corporate profits
at near record

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:44.090
highs, we should encourage
corporations

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.726
to invest more in research and
development

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:49.362
and the salaries of
their employees.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:52.165
It's time for us to invest
in educational opportunity

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.335
to guarantee that we have
the most highly skilled

00:03:55.335 --> 00:03:58.705
workforce in the world,
for 6 out of every

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.274
10 jobs in the near term is
going to require

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:04.644
some education beyond high school.

00:04:04.644 --> 00:04:07.447
Folks, it's long past due
to increase the minimum

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:10.516
wage that will lift
millions of hardworking

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.852
families out of poverty
and in the process

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.455
produce a ripple effect that
boosts wages

00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:17.690
for the middle class and spurs
economic growth

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.993
for the United States of America.

00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.495
Economists acknowledge
that if we do these

00:04:22.495 --> 00:04:26.165
and other things, wages will go up and we'll increase

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:29.569
the Gross Domestic Product
of the United States.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.171
My fellow Americans, we
know how to do this.

00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:33.373
We've done it before.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:35.742
It's the way we used to do
business and

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:37.944
we can do it that way again.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.946
All the middle class in
this country

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.614
want is a chance.

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:44.317
No guarantee,
just a chance.

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.619
Americans want to work.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.455
And when given a fair
shot, the American worker

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:53.526
has never, ever, ever,
let his country down.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.429
Folks, it's never a good
bet to bet against

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.431
the American people.

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.233
Thanks for listening.

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.569
May God bless you, and may
God protect our troops.
