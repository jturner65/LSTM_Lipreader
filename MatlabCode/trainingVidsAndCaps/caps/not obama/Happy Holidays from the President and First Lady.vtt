00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:15.698
The President:
Merry Christmas everybody.

00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:17.266
Now we're not going to
take up too much of your

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.268
time because today's
about family and being

00:00:19.268 --> 00:00:21.270
together with the
ones you love.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.970
And luckily for me that
means I get a little

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:25.274
help on the Weekly
Address as well.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:26.275
Mrs. Obama:
The holidays at the

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.244
White House are such a
wonderful time of year.

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.246
We fill the halls
with decorations,

00:00:30.246 --> 00:00:31.714
Christmas trees,
and carolers.

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:33.716
And this year we
invited more than

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:36.619
65,000 people
to join us.

00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:39.755
Our theme was, "A Children's
Winter Wonderland."

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:42.058
And Americans young and
old had a chance to come

00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.060
together and
celebrate the season.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.062
The President:
And today our family

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:48.297
will join millions across
the country in celebrating

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:49.298
the birth of Jesus.

00:00:49.298 --> 00:00:52.335
The birth of not just
a baby and in a manger

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.970
but the message that
has changed the world.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.941
To reach out to the sick,
the hungry, the troubled,

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:02.912
and above all else to love
one another as we would

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.013
be loved ourselves.

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:05.581
Mrs. Obama:
We hope that this

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:09.552
holiday season will be a chance
for us to live out that message.

00:01:09.552 --> 00:01:12.254
To bridge our differences
and lift up our family,

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:14.023
friends, and neighbors.

00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:16.258
And to reconnect
with the values that

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:17.793
bind us together.

00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:20.996
And as a country that
also means celebrating

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.599
and honoring those who
have served and sacrificed

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.967
for all of us.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.203
Our troops, veterans,
and their families.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:29.205
The President:
In just a few days

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:31.874
our combat mission in
Afghanistan will be over.

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:34.510
Our longest war will come
to a responsible end.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.046
And that gives us an
opportunity to step back

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:40.383
and reflect upon all that
these families have given us.

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:42.418
We're able to gather with
family and friends because

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:45.054
our troops are willing to
hug theirs goodbye and

00:01:45.054 --> 00:01:47.022
step forward to serve.

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:49.759
After a long day we can
come home because they're

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.027
willing to leave their
families and deploy.

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:54.964
We can celebrate the
holidays because

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.133
they're willing to
miss their own.

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.235
Mrs. Obama:
And so as our troops

00:01:59.235 --> 00:02:02.972
continue to transition back
home, back to our businesses,

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:04.974
our schools, our
congregations, and our

00:02:04.974 --> 00:02:08.411
communities, it's up to
all of us to serve them

00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:09.979
as well as they've
served us.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.882
And you can visit
joiningforces.gov

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.284
to find out how you can honor
and support the troops,

00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:18.521
veterans, and military
families in your communities.

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:20.723
That's something we can
do not only during the

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:23.092
holiday season but
all year around.

00:02:23.092 --> 00:02:25.094
The President:
So Merry Christmas everybody.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:27.463
May God bless you
all and we wish you

00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:31.567
and your family a happy
and healthy 2015.
