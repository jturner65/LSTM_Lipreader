Francine Wheeler:
Hi.

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.567
As you've probably noticed,
I'm not the President.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm just a citizen.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.333
And as a citizen, I'm here at
the White House today because I

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:20.800
want to make a difference
and I hope you will join me.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.133
My name is Francine Wheeler.

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:25.633
My husband David is with me.

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:28.834
We live in Sandy
Hook, Connecticut.

00:00:28.834 --> 00:00:31.500
David and I have two sons.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.533
Our older son Nate,
soon to be 10 years old,

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.333
is a fourth grader at Sandy
Hook Elementary School.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.900
Our younger son, Ben, age six,
was murdered in his first-grade

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.600
classroom on December
14th, exactly 4 months ago

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.567
this weekend.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.834
David and I lost
our beloved son,

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.300
and Nate lost his best friend.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.567
On what turned out to be the
last morning of his life,

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:03.467
Ben told me, quite out of the
blue, "I still want to be an

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:08.400
"architect, Mama, but I also
want to be a paleontologist,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.767
"because that's what Nate is
going to be and I want to do

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.967
"everything Nate does."

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.567
Ben's love of fun and his
excitement at the wonders of

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.700
life were unmatched.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.533
His boundless energy kept him
running across the soccer field

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.967
long after the game was over.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:28.100
And he couldn't wait to
get to school every morning.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.533
He sang with perfect pitch and
had just played at his third

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:33.233
piano recital.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.133
Irrepressibly
bright and spirited,

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:40.600
Ben experienced
life at full tilt.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.800
Until that morning.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.834
20 of our children, and
6 of our educators -- gone.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:53.266
Out of the blue.

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:55.934
I've heard people say that
the tidal wave of anguish our

00:01:55.934 --> 00:02:00.166
country felt on
12/14 has receded.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.133
But not for us.

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:06.500
To us, it feels as if it
happened just yesterday.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.934
And in the four months since
we lost our loved ones,

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:15.934
thousands of other Americans
have died at the end of a gun.

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:19.133
Thousands of other families
across the United States are

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:22.367
also drowning in our grief.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:26.100
Please help us do something
before our tragedy becomes

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.900
your tragedy.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.100
Sometimes, I close my eyes and
all I can remember is that awful

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.367
day waiting at the Sandy Hook
Volunteer Firehouse for the boy

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:43.734
who would never come home -- the
same firehouse that was home to

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:48.233
Ben's Tiger Scout Den 6.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.433
But other times, I feel Ben's
presence filling me with courage

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:58.633
for what I have to do -- for him
and all the others taken from us

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:03.033
so violently and too soon.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:07.266
We have to convince the Senate
to come together and pass

00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.433
commonsense gun responsibility
reforms that will make our

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:15.600
communities safer and prevent
more tragedies like the one we

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.033
never thought
would happen to us.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.600
When I packed for
Washington on Monday,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.667
it looked like the Senate
might not act at all.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:30.300
Then, after the President
spoke in Hartford,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.433
and a dozen of us met with
Senators to share our stories,

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:39.400
more than two-thirds of the
Senate voted to move forward.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.166
But that's only the start.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.800
They haven't yet passed any
bills that will help keep guns

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.667
out of the hands of
dangerous people.

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:53.967
And a lot of people are fighting
to make sure they never do.

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.867
Now is the time to act.

00:03:56.867 --> 00:03:58.834
Please join us.

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:01.600
You can talk to
your Senator, too.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.834
Or visit WhiteHouse.gov to find
out how you can help join the

00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:09.633
President and get involved.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:14.100
Help this be the moment
when real change begins.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.133
From the bottom of
my heart, thank you.
