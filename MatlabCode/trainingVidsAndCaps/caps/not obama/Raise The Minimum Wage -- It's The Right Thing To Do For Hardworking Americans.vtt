00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.300
The Vice President: Ladies and
gentlemen, I'm Joe Biden.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.834
I'm filling in for
President Obama,

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:14.667
who is abroad.

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:17.033
I want to talk to you
today about the minimum

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:19.500
wage and the overwhelming
need to raise

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.900
the minimum wage.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.667
There's no reason in the
world why an American

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:27.333
working 40 hours a week
has to live in poverty.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.266
But right now a worker
earning the federal

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:33.300
minimum wage makes
about $14,500 a year.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.834
And you all know that's
incredibly hard

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:40.066
for an individual to live on,
let alone raise a family on.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.867
But if we raise the
minimum wage to $10.10

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.700
an hour, that same worker
will be making $20,200

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.700
a year-and with existing tax
credits would earn enough

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.166
to bring that family or
a family

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:54.700
of four out of poverty.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.166
But there's a lot of good
reasons why raising

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.700
the minimum wage makes sense.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.533
Not only would it put more
hard-earned money into

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.900
the pockets of 28 million
Americans, moving millions

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.900
of them out of poverty,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.333
it's also good for business.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.900
And let me tell you why.

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.633
There's clear data that
shows fair wages generate

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:19.567
loyalty of workers to
their employers,

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.834
which has the benefit of
increasing productivity

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:23.367
and leading to less turn over.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:27.633
It's really good for the
economy as a whole because

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.900
raising the minimum
wage would generate

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.967
an additional $19 billion
in additional income

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.400
for people who need
it the most.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.400
The big difference between
giving a raise

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.567
in the minimum wage instead of
a tax break

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.233
to the very wealthy is the
minimum wage worker will

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.433
go out and spend every penny of
it because they're

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.133
living on the edge.

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.233
They'll spend it in
the local economy.

00:01:50.233 --> 00:01:51.800
They need it to pay their
electric bill,

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.467
put gas in their automobile, to
buy fundamental necessities.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.667
And this generates
economic growth

00:01:58.667 --> 00:01:59.667
in their communities.

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:01.934
And I'm not the only one
who recognizes

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:02.934
these benefits.

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:06.066
Companies big and small
recognize it as well.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:09.000
I was recently in Atlanta,
Georgia, and met the owner

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.633
of a small advertising
company,

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.467
a guy named Darien.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.133
He independently raised
the wages of his workers

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:17.500
to $10.10 an hour.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.300
But large companies, as
well, Costco

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.400
and the Gap-they're choosing to
pay their

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.233
employees higher starting wages.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.533
A growing list of
governors are also raising

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:29.367
wages in their states
- the minimum wage.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.367
They join the President
who raised the minimum

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.633
wage for employees of
federal contractors like

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.133
the folks serving our
troops meals on our bases.

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.834
They're all doing this
for a simple reason.

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:43.500
Raising the minimum wage
will help hardworking

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.467
people rise
out of poverty.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.200
It's good for business.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.367
It's helpful to the
overall economy.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.400
And there's one more
important benefit.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.734
Right now women make up
more than half

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:57.233
of the workers who would benefit
from increasing

00:02:57.233 --> 00:02:58.800
the minimum wage.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.700
Folks, a low minimum wage
is one of the reasons why

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.300
women in America make only
77 cents on a dollar that

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.767
every man makes.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:10.533
But by raising the minimum
wage, we can close that

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.100
gap by 5 percent.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.500
And it matters.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.000
It matters to a lot of
hardworking families,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.967
particularly moms raising
families

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.033
on the minimum wage.

00:03:19.867 --> 00:03:21.900
And one more thing,
folks-it's what the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.100
American people
want to do.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.567
Three out of four
Americans support raising

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:28.000
the minimum wage.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.834
They know this is the
right and fair thing

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.633
to do, and the good thing
to do for the economy.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:35.133
So it's time for Congress
to get behind the minimum

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:37.700
wage bill offered by
Tom Harkin of Iowa

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.200
and Congressman George Miller
of California-the proposal

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.333
that would raise the
federal minimum wage

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.433
from $7.25 an hour to
$10.10 an hour.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.300
So ask your
representatives who oppose

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.467
raising the federal
minimum wage-why

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:54.433
do they oppose it?

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.000
How can we look at the men
and women providing basic

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.100
services to us all, like
cleaning our offices,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.600
caring for our children,
serving in our restaurants

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.767
and so many other
areas-how can we say

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.300
they don't deserve enough
pay to take them

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.300
out of poverty?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.567
The President and I
think they deserve it.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.667
And we think a
lot of you do too.

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.667
So, folks, it's
time to act.

00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:18.200
It's time to give
America a raise.

00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:21.700
Thanks for listening and
have a great weekend.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.500
God bless you all and may
God protect our troops.
