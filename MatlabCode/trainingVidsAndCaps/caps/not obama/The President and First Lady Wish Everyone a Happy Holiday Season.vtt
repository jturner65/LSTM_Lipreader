00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:08.800
The President:
Hello everybody, and happy holidays.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.500
Mrs. Obama:
We know how busy
this time of year is for

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.266
everyone, so we're not going
to take much of your time.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.467
But we did want to take a
moment to wish you all

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:19.266
a Merry Christmas, from our
family to yours.

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.266
The President:
This is a season
for millions of Americans

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:24.233
to be together with family, to
continue long-held holiday

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:28.367
traditions, and to show our
gratitude to those we love.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:30.433
And along the way, some of
us might even watch a little

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:34.133
basketball or eat some
Christmas cookies, too.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.433
Mrs. Obama:
Here at the White
House, over the past few weeks,

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:40.734
we've had about 70,000 people
from all across the country come

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:43.800
visit us and look at
our holiday decorations.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800
This year's theme was "Gather
Around: Stories of the Season."

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
And in every room of the house,
we tried to tell a story about

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
who we are as Americans and
how we celebrate

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.433
the holidays together.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.400
And we made certain to highlight
some of the most powerful

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.433
stories we know - the stories
of our outstanding troops,

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.000
veterans, and military families
and their service and sacrifice

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.767
for our country.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:09.533
The President:
Our extraordinary
men and women in uniform are

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.600
serving so that the rest of
us can enjoy the blessings

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.667
we cherish during the holidays.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.233
But that means many of our
troops are far away from home

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.300
and far from family.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.533
They're spending some extra time
on the phone with their loved

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:23.166
ones back home.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:25.233
Or they're setting up video
chats so they can watch

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:27.200
as the presents are opened.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.033
Today, we want all of our troops
to know that you're in our

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:33.333
thoughts and prayers
this holiday season.

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.767
And here's the good news: For
many of our troops and newest

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.300
veterans, this might be the
first time in years that they've

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.166
been with their
families on Christmas.

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.000
In fact, with the Iraq war
over and the transition

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.467
in Afghanistan, fewer of our
men and women in uniform are

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:52.300
deployed in harm's way than at
any time in the last decade.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.567
Mrs. Obama:
That's something
we all can be thankful for.

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.600
And with more and more of
our troops back here at home,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.467
now it's our turn to serve -
it's our turn to step up and

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.667
show our gratitude for the
military families who have given

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.266
us so much.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.166
That's why Jill Biden and I
started our Joining Forces

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.500
initiative - to rally all
Americans to support our

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.200
military families in
ways large and small.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.467
And again and again, we have
been overwhelmed by the response

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.500
we've gotten as folks from
across the country have found

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.934
new ways to give back to these
families through their schools,

00:02:26.934 --> 00:02:29.834
businesses, and
houses of worship.

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:31.567
The President:
That's the same
spirit of giving that connects

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.900
all of us during the holidays.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.100
So many people all across the
country are helping out

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.533
at soup kitchens, buying gifts
for children in need,

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:43.100
or organizing food or clothing
drives for their neighbors.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.333
For families like ours, that
service is a chance to celebrate

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.834
the birth of Christ and live out
what He taught us - to love our

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:53.200
neighbors as we love ourselves;
to feed the hungry and look

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.166
after the sick; to be our
brother's keeper

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:58.033
and our sister's keeper.

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:00.667
And for all of us as Americans,
regardless of our faith,

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:03.633
those are values that can drive
us to be better parents

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.400
and friends, better
neighbors and better citizens.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.567
Mrs. Obama:
So as we look to the New Year,

00:03:09.567 --> 00:03:14.600
let's pledge ourselves to living
out those values by reaching out

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.800
and lifting up those in our
communities who could

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.834
use a hand up.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:20.500
The President:
So Merry
Christmas, everyone.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.900
And from the two of us, as well
as Malia, Sasha, Grandma, Bo...

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.200
Mrs. Obama:
And Sunny,
the newest Obama...

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.667
The President:
We wish you all a
blessed and safe holiday season.

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.633
Mrs. Obama:
Happy holidays
everybody, and God bless.
