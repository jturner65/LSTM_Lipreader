00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:09.809
The Vice President:
Hello everyone,

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.211
this is Joe Biden.

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.213
I want to wish you
all a Happy New Year.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:15.849
I know this is the time
of year when we make

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.051
resolutions to take care
of our health, whether

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.453
it's joining a gym
or eating healthier.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:24.157
But there's one thing you
can do right now that will

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.593
also make a big difference
in your health:

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:29.796
that is getting quality,
affordable health

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.632
insurance through the
Affordable Care Act.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.834
Because of that law,
access to quality

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.936
health care
is improving.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.106
Last year, almost 7
million people signed

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:42.776
up for health care
coverage under the new law

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.943
and paid their
premiums.

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:47.614
And in many cases the cost
of health care is less

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.584
than the cost of your cell
phone or your cable bill.

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.687
In addition, millions
more are getting the care

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.823
that they need
through Medicaid that

00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:58.658
they weren't
getting before.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:02.195
And because of the new
law, people who already

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.931
had health insurance are
also benefitting from

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:05.932
additional
protections.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:08.034
For example, their
insurance companies

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:10.637
can't deny them coverage
because of pre-existing

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:13.440
conditions, like
asthma or diabetes.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.643
And they're able to get --
for free -- preventive

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.045
services like mammograms
or blood pressure

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:21.414
screenings that their
doctors ordered for them,

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:23.683
saving them a
lot of money.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.885
Everyone is beginning to
realize what millions

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.220
of you already
know -- the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.689
Affordable Care
Act is working.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.025
And we're just
getting started.

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.027
Because there are millions
more of you who can

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.597
get quality, affordable health
care if you sign up before

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.266
February 15th
of this year.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.635
That's now through
February 15th.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:45.605
Now if you don't have
insurance, you can

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:48.074
go to HealthCare.gov,
where you'll find a menu

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:51.211
of a bunch of different plans
and what each plan covers

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.580
and how much
each plan costs.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.182
All you have to do
is just pick one.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.384
The best one that fits
your family's health care

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.686
needs and your
family's budget.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.555
If you don't want to go
to HealthCare.gov and you

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.458
want to talk to somebody
on the phone instead,

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:07.460
you can call, I'm going to
give you the number now,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.334
you can call
1-800-318-2596.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.936
From this moment on, you
can call any time of the

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:18.938
day, any day
of the week.

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:23.877
Phone lines are open 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:26.112
And for folks listening
today whose family

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.314
and friends may
not speak English:

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.850
let them know that there
are translators available

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.554
in over 150 language to guide
them through the process.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.190
And if you're not
comfortable going online

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.826
or speaking on the phone,
and you want to sit down

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.529
with an individual to help
you through this, you can

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.998
find out where
to go as well.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:47.033
Because in every
community, at local

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:50.036
libraries or community
health centers, people

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.704
are there to help.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.908
All you have to do is
go on HealthCare.gov,

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.644
type in where you live, and
you can find out exactly where

00:02:57.644 --> 00:03:00.413
to go to sit down with
a person who will help

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:02.448
you walk through
the process.

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.450
But here's the really
important point

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.451
I want to make.

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:09.489
If you don't sign up by
February 15th of this year

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.524
-- with only a very few
exceptions -- if you don't

00:03:11.524 --> 00:03:13.993
sign up by the 15th of
this year, you're going

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.897
to have to wait until 2016
to get health insurance

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.933
through the
Affordable Care Act.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.368
And even those of
you who already have

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.804
health insurance through
the Affordable Care Act,

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:28.141
you can also go on
HealthCare.gov to find

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.643
a plan that might offer
more benefits or be more

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.712
affordable in
price for you.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:35.715
You might even qualify for
additional help paying for

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.518
the insurance you choose
because your income

00:03:38.518 --> 00:03:40.720
isn't what it
was last year.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.889
Now I'm sure some of you
already heard from your

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.625
friends and neighbors
who've signed up for

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.328
health insurance under the
Affordable Care Act what

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.196
I hear all around
the country.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.566
I hear it provides peace
of mind that someone you

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.336
love will be covered if
God-forbid something happens.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:04:00.139
It provides security, so
if you have a bad strain

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.609
in your ankle or your back
and you don't have the

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.611
money to get treatment,
you can now get the

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:06.613
treatment rather than
wait, put it off,

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.615
and end up with a
chronic condition.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.617
And it provides a lot
of freedom, and choice,

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:13.286
and opportunity -- so you
can switch jobs or move

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.922
to another city without the
fear that you'll lose out

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:17.924
on the health insurance
with the company

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.325
you now have
it with.

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.494
And what I'm hearing
most is how pleased

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:24.931
and excited people are
about how affordable it is.

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:27.200
An awful lot of people who
didn't think they could

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.202
or would find
quality, affordable

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.405
health insurance are actually
able to get assistance

00:04:32.405 --> 00:04:34.374
from the government to
help them pay for their

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:36.409
health care plans
at a cheaper rate.

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.444
Let me give
you an example.

00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:42.649
A family of four with an
income of around $95,000,

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:45.218
they can still get a
subsidy to lower their

00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:47.186
health care premiums.

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.555
But maybe most
importantly, what I hear

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:52.191
is that we have finally
ended the debate in this

00:04:52.191 --> 00:04:55.161
country of whether or
not health insurance

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:57.730
is a right or
a privilege.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.700
We think everyone in
America has a right

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.436
to have adequate
health care insurance.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:07.473
And the Affordable Care
Act gives them that right.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:08.841
So sign up.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:09.842
And spread the word.

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.845
Protect your health --
not only for your sake,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:15.615
but for the sake of
your families.

00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:18.384
Thanks for listening, and
Jill and I wish you again

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.554
a happy and
healthy New Year.

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:24.757
God bless you, and may
God protect our troops.
