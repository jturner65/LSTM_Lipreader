The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:09.734
This weekend, as you gather
with family and friends,

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.633
Michelle and I want to wish
you a Merry Christmas and a

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:14.133
Happy Holidays.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.767
The First Lady:
We both love this time of year.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:18.633
And there's nothing quite like
celebrating the holidays at

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:19.633
the White House.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.734
It's an incredible experience
and one that we try to share

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:24.967
with as many folks as possible.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.166
This month, more than 90,000
people will come through the

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.767
White House to see the
holiday decorations.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:35.166
And our theme for this year's
holiday season was "Joy to All"

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.767
-- a reminder to appreciate
the many joys of the holidays:

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.734
the joy of giving, the joy
of service and, of course,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.934
the joy of homecomings.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:44.934
The President:
That's right.

00:00:44.934 --> 00:00:46.700
This weekend, parents are
picking up their kids from

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.333
college -- and making room
for all the laundry they

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.633
bring with them.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.533
Children are counting
down the hours until the

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.000
grandparents arrive.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.233
And uncles, aunts and cousins
are all making their way to join

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.133
the family and share
in the holiday spirit.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.667
The First Lady:
That's what makes this
season so special --

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.033
getting to spend time with
the people we love most.

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:08.367
The President:
And this year, that's
especially true for some of our

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.133
military families.

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:12.400
You see, the war
in Iraq is over.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.133
The transition in
Afghanistan is underway.

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:19.300
And after a decade of war,
our heroes are coming home.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.400
All across America, military
families are reuniting.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.667
So this week let's give
thanks for our veterans and

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:26.900
their families.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.300
And let's say a prayer
for all our troops --

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.266
especially those
in Afghanistan --

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.066
who are spending this
holiday overseas,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.500
risking their lives to
defend the freedoms that we

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.100
hold so dear.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.533
The First Lady:
And remember, when our men and
women in uniform answer the call

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.266
to serve, their families
serve right along with them.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.467
All across the country, military
spouses have been raising their

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.567
families all alone during
those long deployments.

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:54.066
And let's not forget
about our military kids,

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:56.967
moving from base to base and
school to school every few

00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.433
years, and stepping up to
help out at home when mom or

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:01.967
dad is away.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:05.834
Our military families sacrifice
so much on our behalf,

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:09.667
and Barack and I believe that
we should serve them as well as

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.166
they serve this country.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.700
That's why Dr. Jill Biden and
I started Joining Forces --

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.934
an effort to rally all Americans
to honor and support our

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:19.934
veterans and military families.

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:23.967
Just go to JoiningForces.gov to
find out how you can show your

00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:26.333
gratitude for their service.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.867
The President:
Because that's what this
season is all about.

00:02:28.867 --> 00:02:30.667
For my family and
millions of Americans,

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:33.633
it's a time to celebrate
the birth of Christ.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.934
To reflect on His life and
learn from His example.

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:39.367
Every year, we commit
to love one another.

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:40.767
To give of ourselves.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:42.400
To be our brother's keeper.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.367
To be our sister's keeper.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:47.767
But those ideas are not
just part of our faith.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:49.100
They're part of all faiths.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.867
And they unite us as Americans.

00:02:51.867 --> 00:02:55.033
The First Lady:
In this country, we
take care of each other.

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:58.800
And in this season of giving,
it's inspiring to see so many

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.233
people all across America
taking the time to help those

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:03.934
most in need.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:07.066
The President:
That's part of what makes us
such a compassionate nation.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:09.600
And this year, I know many of
you are extending that kindness

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.166
to the families who are still
picking up the pieces from

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.233
Hurricane Sandy and extending
your prayers to the people of

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:16.934
Newtown, Connecticut.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:20.266
The First Lady:
So thank you for all that you've
done this year on behalf of your

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.800
fellow Americans.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.033
The President:
And on behalf of my
favorite Americans --

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:29.500
Michelle, Malia, Sasha and Bo
-- Merry Christmas, everybody.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.533
The First Lady:
Happy holidays.
