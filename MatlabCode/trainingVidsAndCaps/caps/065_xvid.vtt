00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:11.378
The President: Hi, everybody.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.981
My top priority as President is
doing everything I can to create

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:18.184
more jobs and more opportunities
for hardworking families

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.686
to get ahead.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.055
On Friday, we learned that
our economy created over

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.858
200,000 new jobs in July.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.895
That's on top of about
300,000 new jobs in June.

00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:31.598
We're now in a six-month
streak with at least 200,

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.833
000 new jobs each month.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:37.036
That hasn't happened since 1997.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:40.607
All told, our businesses have
created 9.9 million jobs

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.909
over the past 53 months.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.945
That's the longest streak of
private-sector job creation

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.814
in our history.

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.351
Because of you - because of your
hard work and determination -

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.888
America has recovered faster and
come farther than almost any

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:57.590
other advanced country on Earth.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.427
The economy is clearly
getting stronger.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.429
Things are clearly
getting better.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.131
And the decisions we
make now can keep things

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.300
moving in that direction.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.302
That's what's at
stake right now.

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:12.305
Making sure our economy works
for every working American.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:15.074
Making sure that people who
work hard can get ahead.

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.544
That's why I've been pushing
for common-sense ideas like

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.013
rebuilding our infrastructure in
a way that supports millions

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.183
of good jobs and helps our
businesses compete.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.652
That's why I've been pushing
to raise the minimum wage.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.620
To make it easier for
working folks to pay

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.255
off their student loans.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:33.059
That's why I've been pushing
for fair pay and paid leave.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:35.261
These policies have
two things in common.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:37.363
All of them would help
working families feel

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.365
more stable and secure.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.434
And unfortnately all of
them have been blocked

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.604
or ignored by
Republicans in Congress.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:47.173
That's why my administration
keeps taking what actions

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:51.144
we can on our own to
help working families -

00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:54.380
because Congress is doing so
little for working families.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.716
House Republicans actually
got together this week

00:01:56.716 --> 00:02:00.420
and voted to sue me for
taking actions on my own.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.555
And then they left town for
the month without settling

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:05.225
a bunch of unfinished business
that matters to working

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:07.694
families across America.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.563
The bottom line is this - we've
come a long way these past

00:02:10.563 --> 00:02:12.098
five and a half years.

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.534
Our challenges are nowhere
near as daunting as they

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:15.535
were back then.

00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:18.571
But imagine how much farther
along our economy would be -

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.441
how much stronger our country
would be - if Congress

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.043
would do its job.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.246
I'll never stop trying to
work with both parties

00:02:26.246 --> 00:02:28.314
to get things moving faster
for the middle class

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.884
and everybody who's working
to get into the middle class.

00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:33.353
And I could use your help.

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:35.688
If you see your Member of
Congress around home this month,

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.957
tell him or her
what's on your mind.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.960
Ask them why they haven't passed
bills to raise the minimum wage

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.364
or help with student loans
or enact fair pay for women.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.433
And when they return from
vacation next month,

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.435
instead of trying to pass
partisan bills on party

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:51.905
lines, hopefully we can come
together with the sense

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.140
of common purpose
that you expect.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.743
And in the meantime, I will
never stop doing whatever

00:02:56.743 --> 00:03:00.513
I can, whenever I can, not
only to make sure that our

00:03:00.513 --> 00:03:04.951
economy succeeds, but that
people like you succeed.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:06.953
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
