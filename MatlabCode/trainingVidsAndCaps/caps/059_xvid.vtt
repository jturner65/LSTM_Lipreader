00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.900
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.033
Our top priority as a nation is
reigniting the true engine of

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:13.600
our economic growth -- a
rising, thriving middle class.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.867
And few things define what it is
to be middle class in America

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:19.000
more than owning your
own cornerstone of the

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.967
American Dream: a home.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:25.100
Today, seven years after the
real estate bubble burst,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.266
triggering the worst economic
crisis since the Great

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.500
Depression and costing millions
of responsible Americans their

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.567
jobs and their homes, our
housing market is healing.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.800
Sales are up.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.567
Foreclosures are down.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.467
Construction is expanding.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:42.533
And thanks to rising home
prices over the past year,

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.500
1.7 million more American
families have been able to come

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
up for air, because they're
no longer underwater on

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.133
their mortgages.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:53.533
From the day I took office,
I've made it a priority to help

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.567
responsible homeowners and
prevent the kind of recklessness

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.500
that helped cause this
crisis in the first place.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.800
My housing plan has already
helped more than two million

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.834
people refinance
their mortgages,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:07.600
and they're saving an
average of $3,000 per year.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.000
My new consumer watchdog agency
is moving forward on protections

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.133
like a simpler, shorter mortgage
form that will help to keep

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.266
hard-working families
from getting ripped off.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.467
But we've got more work to do.

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:21.900
We've got more responsible
homeowners to help --

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.233
folks who have never
missed a mortgage payment,

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:27.433
but aren't allowed to refinance;
working families who have done

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.133
everything right, but still
owe more on their homes

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:31.166
than they're worth.

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:34.600
Last week, I nominated a man
named Mel Watt to take on these

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600
challenges as the head of the
Federal Housing Finance Agency.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.300
Mel's represented the people of
North Carolina in Congress for

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.900
20 years, and in that time, he
helped lead efforts to put in

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.200
place rules of the road that
protect consumers from dishonest

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.300
mortgage lenders, and give
responsible Americans the chance

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.200
to own their own home.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.133
He's the right
person for the job,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:57.200
and that's why Congress
should do its job,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.433
and confirm him without delay.

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.400
And they shouldn't stop there.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.033
As I said before, more than two
million Americans have already

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.900
refinanced at today's low
rates, but we can do a lot

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.200
better than that.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.467
I've called on Congress to give
every responsible homeowner the

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:13.367
chance to refinance,
and with it,

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:16.800
the opportunity to
save $3,000 a year.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.367
That's like a $3,000 tax cut.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.700
And if you're one of the
millions of Americans who could

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.200
take advantage of that, you
should ask your representative

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.433
in Congress why they
won't act on it.

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:30.800
Our economy and our housing
market are poised for progress

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.133
-- but we could do so much
more if we work together.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.367
More good jobs.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.967
Greater security for
middle-class families.

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.967
A sense that your
hard work is rewarded.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.233
That's what I'm fighting for --
and that's what I'm going to

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:46.433
keep fighting for as long
as I hold this office.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.433
Thank you.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.500
And have a great weekend.
