00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:07.396
This week, I spent some
time with Americans

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:09.096
across the country
who are hurting

00:00:09.096 --> 00:00:10.796
because of this
economic crisis.

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:13.086
People closing the
businesses they scrimped

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:14.786
and saved to start.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.206
Families losing the homes
that were their stake

00:00:17.206 --> 00:00:18.906
in the American Dream.

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.736
Folks who have given
up trying to get ahead,

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:22.766
and given in to
the stark reality

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:24.706
of just trying to get by.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:27.676
They've been looking to
those they sent to Washington

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:30.316
for some hope at a time
when they need it most.

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.956
This morning, I'm
pleased to say

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.586
that after a lively debate
full of healthy differences

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:39.236
of opinion, we've delivered
real and tangible progress

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:40.936
for the American people.

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.356
Congress has passed my
economic recovery plan -

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:46.556
an ambitious plan at a
time we badly need it.

00:00:47.196 --> 00:00:50.426
It will save or create
more than 3.5 million jobs

00:00:50.426 --> 00:00:53.566
over the next two years,
ignite spending by businesses

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.516
and consumers alike,
and lay a new foundation

00:00:56.746 --> 00:00:59.466
for our lasting economic
growth and prosperity.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:02.176
This is a major milestone
on our road to recovery,

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:05.266
and I want to thank the Members
of Congress who came together

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.966
in common purpose
to make it happen.

00:01:07.496 --> 00:01:10.296
Because they did, I will
sign this legislation

00:01:10.296 --> 00:01:13.106
into law shortly, and we'll
begin making the immediate

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.136
investments necessary
to put people back

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:17.546
to work doing the work
America needs done.

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:20.396
The work of modernizing
our health care system,

00:01:20.656 --> 00:01:22.846
saving billions of dollars
and countless lives;

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:25.046
and upgrading classrooms,
libraries,

00:01:25.046 --> 00:01:27.936
and labs in our children's
schools across America.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:31.336
The work of building wind
turbines and solar panels

00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:33.286
and the smart grid necessary

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:35.326
to transport the clean
energy they create;

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:39.096
and laying broadband internet
lines to connect rural homes,

00:01:39.236 --> 00:01:42.176
schools, and businesses to
the information superhighway.

00:01:43.026 --> 00:01:45.486
The work of repairing our
crumbling roads and bridges,

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.266
and our dangerously
deficient dams and levees.

00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:50.716
And we'll help folks
who've lost their jobs

00:01:50.716 --> 00:01:52.416
through no fault of their own

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.496
by providing the
unemployment benefits they need

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:56.676
and protecting the
health care they count on.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:00.966
Now, some fear we won't be able
to effectively implement a plan

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:04.086
of this size and scope, and I
understand their skepticism.

00:02:04.836 --> 00:02:07.476
Washington hasn't set a very
good example in recent years.

00:02:07.876 --> 00:02:09.576
And with so much on the line,

00:02:09.576 --> 00:02:11.516
it's time to begin doing
things differently.

00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:15.596
That's why our goal must be to
spend these precious dollars

00:02:15.786 --> 00:02:17.716
with unprecedented
accountability,

00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.266
responsibility,
and transparency.

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:23.626
I've tasked my cabinet and
staff to set up the kind

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:25.826
of management, oversight,
and disclosure

00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:28.996
that will help ensure that,
and I will challenge state

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:30.696
and local governments
to do the same.

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:33.886
Once the plan is put into
action, a new website -

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:36.856
Recovery.gov - will allow
any American to watch

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:38.936
where the money goes and
weigh in with comments

00:02:38.936 --> 00:02:41.706
and questions - and I encourage
every American to do so.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:45.166
Ultimately, this is your
money, and you deserve to know

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:46.896
where it's going
and how it's spent.

00:02:48.346 --> 00:02:51.016
This historic step won't
be the end of what we do

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:53.906
to turn our economy around,
but rather the beginning.

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:57.526
The problems that led us
into this crisis are deep

00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:00.556
and widespread, and our
response must be equal

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:02.256
to the task.

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:05.866
For our plan to succeed,
we must stabilize, repair,

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.916
and reform our banking system,
and get credit flowing again

00:03:08.916 --> 00:03:10.616
to families and businesses.

00:03:11.106 --> 00:03:13.316
We must write and enforce
new rules of the road,

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:15.676
to stop unscrupulous
speculators

00:03:15.876 --> 00:03:17.956
from undermining our
economy ever again.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:21.036
We must stem the
spread of foreclosures

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:22.926
and do everything we can

00:03:22.926 --> 00:03:25.076
to help responsible
homeowners stay in their homes.

00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:28.116
And in the weeks ahead,
I will submit a proposal

00:03:28.116 --> 00:03:30.006
for the federal
budget that will begin

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:33.186
to restore the discipline
these challenging times demand.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:36.256
Our debt has doubled over
the past eight years,

00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:38.736
and we've inherited a
trillion-dollar deficit -

00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:41.786
which we must add to in
the short term in order

00:03:41.786 --> 00:03:43.486
to jumpstart our sick economy.

00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:46.616
But our long-term
economic growth demands

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:49.906
that we tame our burgeoning
federal deficit; that we invest

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:51.906
in the things we
need, and dispense

00:03:51.906 --> 00:03:53.606
with the things we don't.

00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:55.356
This is a challenging agenda,

00:03:55.356 --> 00:03:57.056
but one we can and
will achieve.

00:03:58.326 --> 00:04:00.906
This morning, I'm reminded of
words President Kennedy spoke

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.756
in another time of uncertainty.

00:04:03.716 --> 00:04:05.426
"Do not pray for easy lives.

00:04:06.116 --> 00:04:07.816
Pray to be stronger men.

00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:11.216
Do not pray for tasks
equal to your powers.

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:14.146
Pray for powers
equal to your tasks."

00:04:14.686 --> 00:04:17.466
America, we will prove
equal to this task.

00:04:18.346 --> 00:04:20.106
It will take time, and
it will take effort,

00:04:20.716 --> 00:04:22.746
but working together,
we will turn this crisis

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:26.146
into opportunity and emerge
from our painful present

00:04:26.496 --> 00:04:28.196
into a brighter future.

00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:31.226
After a week spent with the
fundamentally decent men

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:32.926
and women of this nation,

00:04:32.926 --> 00:04:34.676
I have never been
more certain of that.

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.376
Thank you.
