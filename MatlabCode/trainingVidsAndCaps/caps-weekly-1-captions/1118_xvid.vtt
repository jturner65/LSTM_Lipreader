00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.667
The President:
The historic movement
to bring real,

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.467
meaningful health insurance
reform to the American people

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.500
gathered momentum this week as
we approach the final days of

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.800
this debate.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Having worked on this issue
for the better part of a year,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.700
the Senate Finance Committee is
finishing deliberations on their

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.667
version of a health insurance
reform bill that will soon be

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:27.934
merged with other reform bills
produced by other Congressional committees.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.433
After evaluating the
Finance Committee's bill,

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.066
the Congressional
Budget Office --

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.066
an office that
provides independent,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.767
nonpartisan analysis -- concluded that the legislation

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.633
would make coverage affordable for millions of Americans who

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.166
don't have it today.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.433
It will bring greater security
to Americans who have coverage,

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.567
with new insurance protections.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.500
And, by attacking waste and
fraud within the system,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.033
it will slow the growth
in health care costs,

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.100
without adding a
dime to our deficits.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.166
This is another milestone
on what's been a long,

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.200
hard road towards health
insurance reform.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
In recent months, we've heard
every side of every argument

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.633
from both sides of the aisle.

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:08.600
And rightly so -- health insurance reform is a complex

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.066
and critical issue that deserves a vigorous national debate,

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.667
and we've had one.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.433
The approach that is emerging
includes the best ideas from

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:21.200
Republicans and Democrats, and
people across the political spectrum.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.667
In fact, what's remarkable is
not that we've had a spirited

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.767
debate about health
insurance reform,

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:30.900
but the unprecedented consensus
that has come together behind it.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.333
This consensus encompasses
everyone from doctors and nurses

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.133
to hospitals and
drug manufacturers.

00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:40.100
And earlier this week, Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger of

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.567
California and New York City
Mayor Michael Bloomberg came out

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:47.100
in support of reform, joining
two former Republican Senate

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
Majority Leaders: Bob
Dole and Dr. Bill Frist,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.300
himself a cardiac surgeon.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.400
Dr. Louis Sullivan, Secretary of
Health and Human Services under

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.166
President George H.W.
Bush, supports reform.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.700
As does Republican
Tommy Thompson,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.867
a former Wisconsin governor and
Secretary of Health and Human

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:09.633
Services under President
George W. Bush.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.333
These distinguished leaders
understand that health insurance

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:15.767
reform isn't a Democratic
issue or a Republican issue,

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.934
but an American issue
that demands a solution.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:21.233
Still, there are some in
Washington today who seem

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.433
determined to play the
same old partisan politics,

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.400
working to score
political points,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.400
even if it means burdening this
country with an unsustainable

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.800
status quo.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.066
A status quo of rising health
care costs that are crushing our

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:35.767
families, our businesses,
and our government.

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.367
A status quo of diminishing
coverage that's denying

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:42.367
millions of hardworking
Americans the insurance they need.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.333
A status quo that gives big
insurance companies the power to

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:48.867
make arbitrary decisions
about your health care.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:51.133
That's a status quo I reject.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.767
And that's a status quo
the American people reject.

00:02:54.767 --> 00:02:56.934
The distinguished former
Congressional leaders who urged

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:00.867
us to act on health insurance
reform spoke of the historic

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:05.000
moment at hand and reminded us
that this moment will not soon

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.433
come again.

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:09.300
They called on members of
both parties to seize this

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.567
opportunity to finally confront a problem that has plagued us

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.767
for far too long.

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:17.467
That is what we are called
to do at this moment.

00:03:17.467 --> 00:03:21.633
That is the spirit of national
purpose that we must summon right now.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:25.400
Now's the time to rise above
the politics of the moment.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.433
Now's the time to come
together as Americans.

00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:31.600
Now's the time to meet our
responsibilities to ourselves

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.600
and to our children,
and secure a better,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.767
healthier future for
generations to come.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:39.900
That future is within our grasp.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.734
So, let's go finish the job.

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:42.734
Thanks.
