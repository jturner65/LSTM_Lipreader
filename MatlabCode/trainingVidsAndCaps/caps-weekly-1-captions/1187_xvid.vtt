00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:09.500
The President:
All across America, even
today, on a Saturday,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.000
millions of Americans
are hard at work.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.767
They're running the mom and
pop stores and neighborhood

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.800
restaurants we know and love.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.166
They're building tiny startups
with big ideas that could

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:22.500
revolutionize an industry, maybe
even transform our economy.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.467
They are the more than half
of all Americans who work at a

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.333
small business, or
own a small business.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.767
And they embody the
spirit of possibility,

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:34.000
the relentless work ethic, and
the hope for something better

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.567
that is at the heart
of the American Dream.

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:39.567
They also represent a segment of
our economy that has been hard

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:41.433
hit by this recession.

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:43.767
Over the past couple of years,
small businesses have lost

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:46.300
hundreds of thousands of jobs.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.600
Many have struggled to get the
loans they need to finance their

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.767
inventories and make payroll.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:53.166
Many entrepreneurs can't get
financing to start a small

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:55.100
business in the first place.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.967
And many more are discouraged
from even trying because of the

00:00:57.967 --> 00:01:01.633
crushing costs of health care -- costs that have forced too many

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.900
small businesses to
cut benefits, shed jobs,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.000
or shut their doors for good.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.066
Small businesses have always
been the engine of our economy,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.133
creating 65% of all new jobs over the past decade and a half,

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.300
and they must be at the
forefront of our recovery.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.367
That's why the Recovery Act
was designed to help small

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.200
businesses expand
and create jobs.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
It's provided $5 billion
worth of tax relief,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.400
as well as temporarily reducing
or eliminating fees on SBA loans

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.133
and guaranteeing some of
these loans up to 90%,

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.800
which has supported nearly $13
billion in new lending to more

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.734
than 33,000 businesses.

00:01:38.734 --> 00:01:42.000
In addition, our health reform
plan will allow small businesses

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.533
to buy insurance for their
employees through an insurance

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:48.467
exchange, which may offer better
coverage at lower costs --

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:52.166
and we'll provide tax credits
for those that choose to do so.

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:55.467
And this past week, I called on
Congress to increase the maximum

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:58.934
size of various SBA loans, so
that more small business owners

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:02.100
can set up shop and
grow their operations.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.633
I also announced that we'll be
taking additional steps through

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.000
our Financial Stability plan to
make more credit available to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.834
the small local and community
banks that so many small

00:02:10.834 --> 00:02:14.200
businesses depend on -- the banks who know their borrowers,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.000
who gave them their first
loan and watched them grow.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.767
The goal here is to get credit
where it's needed most --

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:24.066
to businesses that support
families, sustain communities,

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.066
and create the jobs
that power our economy.

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.400
That's why we enacted the
Financial Stability Plan in the

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.667
first place, back when many of
our largest banks were on the

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.533
verge of collapse; our
credit markets were frozen;

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:38.767
and it was nearly impossible for
ordinary people to get loans to

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.967
buy a car or home
or pay for college.

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.633
The idea was to jumpstart
lending and keep our economy

00:02:44.633 --> 00:02:47.433
from spiraling
into a depression.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.233
Fortunately, it worked.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:50.934
Thanks to the
American taxpayers,

00:02:50.934 --> 00:02:53.533
we've now achieved the stability
we need to get our economy

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.266
moving forward again.

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:58.433
But while credit may be more
available for large businesses,

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.000
too many small business owners
are still struggling to get the

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.667
credit they need.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.633
These are the very taxpayers who
stood by America's banks in a

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:08.567
crisis -- and now it's time
for our banks to stand by

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:12.066
creditworthy small businesses, and make the loans they need to

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.867
open their doors, grow their operations, and create new jobs.

00:03:15.867 --> 00:03:19.033
It's time for those banks to fulfill their responsibility to

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.633
help ensure a wider recovery,
a more secure system,

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.433
and a more broadly
shared prosperity.

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:27.734
And we're going to take every appropriate step to encourage

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.333
them to meet those responsibilities.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.200
Because if it's one
thing we've learned,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.300
it's that here in America,
we rise and fall together.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.700
Our economy as a whole can't move ahead if small businesses

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.166
and the middle class
continue to fall behind.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.200
This country was
built by dreamers.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.333
They're the workers who took
a chance on their desire to be

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:47.767
their own boss.

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:51.100
The part-time inventors
who became the fulltime entrepreneurs.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.300
The men and women who have
helped build the American middle

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.467
class, keeping alive that
most American of ideals --

00:03:57.467 --> 00:04:00.166
that all things are
possible for all people,

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.467
and we're limited only by the
size of our dreams and our

00:04:02.467 --> 00:04:04.567
willingness to work for them.

00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:07.700
We need to do everything we can
to ensure that they can keep

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.333
taking those risks,
acting on those dreams,

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.567
and building the enterprises
that fuel our economy and make

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:15.133
us who we are.

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:16.133
Thanks.
