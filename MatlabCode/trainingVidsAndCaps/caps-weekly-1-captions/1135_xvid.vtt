00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:09.133
The President:
For centuries, in peace and in war, in prosperity and in

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:12.667
adversity, Americans have paused
at this time of year to gather

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:16.000
with loved ones and give thanks
for life's blessings.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.800
This week, we carry on this
distinctly American tradition.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.533
All across our country, folks
are coming together to spend

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:26.233
time with family, to catch up
with old friends, to cook and

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:28.533
enjoy a big dinner - and maybe
to watch a little

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:30.667
football in between.

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:34.200
As always, we give thanks for
the kindness of loved ones, for

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.834
the joys of the previous year,
and for the pride we feel in our

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:40.000
communities and country.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.533
We keep in our thoughts and
prayers the many families

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.100
marking this Thanksgiving with
an empty seat - saved for a son

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.700
or daughter, or husband or wife,
stationed in harm's way.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
And we say a special thanks for
the sacrifices those men and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.166
women in uniform are making for
our safety and freedom, and for

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.767
all those Americans who enrich
the lives of our communities

00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:04.200
through acts of kindness,
generosity and service.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.100
But as much as we all have to be
thankful for, we also know that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.233
this year millions of Americans
are facing very

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.433
difficult economic times.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:14.400
Many have lost jobs in this
recession -

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.333
the worst in generations.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:18.667
Many more are struggling to
afford health care premiums and

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:20.667
house payments, let alone to
save for an

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.900
education or
retirement.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.166
Too many are wondering if the
dream of a middle class life -

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.100
that American Dream - is
slipping away.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.333
It's the worry I hear from folks
across the country; good,

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.800
hard-working people doing the
best they can for their families

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.300
- but fearing that their best
just isn't good enough.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.934
These are not strangers.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.033
They are our family, our
friends, and our neighbors.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:46.900
Their struggles must be our
concern.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.367
That's why we passed the
Recovery Act that cut taxes for

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.934
95 percent of working people and
for small businesses - and that

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:55.567
extended unemployment benefits
and health coverage for millions

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.500
of Americans who lost their jobs
in this turmoil.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.233
That's why we are reforming the
health care system so that

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:04.433
middle-class families have
affordable insurance that cannot

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.500
be denied because of a
pre-existing condition or taken

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.934
away because you happen
to get sick.

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.533
We've worked to stem the tide of
foreclosures and to stop the

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.367
decline in home values.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.700
We're making it easier to save
for retirement and more

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.834
affordable to send a son or
daughter to college.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.433
The investments we have made and
tough steps we have taken have

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.400
helped break the back of the
recession, and now our economy

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.166
is finally growing again.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.934
But as I said when I took
office, job recovery from this

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:33.700
crisis would not come easily or
quickly.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.433
Though the job losses we were
experiencing earlier this year

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.367
have slowed dramatically, we're
still not creating enough new

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:43.033
jobs each month to make up for
the ones we're losing.

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.967
And no matter what the
economists say, for families and

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:49.734
communities across the country,
this recession will not end

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:52.667
until we completely turn that
tide.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.266
So we've made progress.

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:57.734
But we cannot rest - and my
administration will not rest -

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:00.567
until we have revived this
economy and rebuilt it stronger

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:03.533
than before; until we are
creating jobs and opportunities

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:07.100
for middle class families; until
we have moved beyond the cycles

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.900
of boom and bust - of reckless
risk and speculation - that led

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.066
us to so much crisis and pain
these past few years.

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:17.400
Next week, I'll be meeting with
owners of large and small

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.066
businesses, labor leaders, and
non-for-profits from across the

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:24.633
country, to talk about the
additional steps we can take to

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.934
help spur job creation.

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:30.700
I will work with the Congress to
enact them quickly.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.166
And it is my fervent hope - and
my heartfelt expectation - that

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:37.033
next Thanksgiving we will be
able to celebrate the fact that

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:40.233
many of those who have lost
their jobs are back at work, and

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.734
that as a nation we will have
come through these difficult

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:47.000
storms stronger and wiser and
grateful to have reached

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.767
a brighter day.

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:52.333
Thank you, God bless you, and
from my family to yours,

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.400
Happy Thanksgiving.
