00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:12.094
The President:
At this time last year, amidst headlines about banks on the

00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:16.461
verge of collapse and job
losses of 700,000 a month,

00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:19.761
we received another troubling
piece of news about our economy.

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:22.561
Our economy was shrinking
at an alarming rate --

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:25.494
the largest six-month
decline in 50 years.

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:28.161
Our factories and farms
were producing less;

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:30.061
our businesses
were selling less;

00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.961
and more job losses
were on the horizon.

00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.895
One year later, according to
numbers released this past week,

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:39.294
this trend has reversed itself.

00:00:39.294 --> 00:00:42.961
For the past six months, our
economy has been growing again.

00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:46.428
And last quarter, it grew more
quickly than at any time in the

00:00:46.428 --> 00:00:48.561
past six years.

00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.394
This is a sign of progress.

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:52.961
And it's an affirmation of the
difficult decisions we made last

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:56.728
year to pull our financial
system back from the brink and

00:00:56.728 --> 00:00:58.861
get our economy moving again.

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.528
But when so many people
are still struggling --

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:04.961
when one in ten Americans
still can't find work,

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:08.361
and millions more are working
harder and longer for less --

00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:11.127
our mission isn't just
to grow the economy.

00:01:11.127 --> 00:01:13.628
It's to grow jobs for
folks who want them,

00:01:13.628 --> 00:01:17.394
and ensure wages that are
rising for those who have them.

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:20.528
It's not just about improvements
we see in quarterly statistics,

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:23.561
but ones people feel
in their daily lives --

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.127
a bigger paycheck;
more security;

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:29.628
the ability to give your kids
a decent shot in life and still

00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:32.261
have enough to
retire on one day.

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:36.994
That's why job creation will be
our number one focus in 2010.

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:39.361
We'll put more Americans
back to work rebuilding our

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.961
infrastructure all
across the country.

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.528
And since the true engines
of job creation are America's

00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:48.294
businesses, I've proposed tax
credits to help them hire new

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:53.227
workers, raise wages, and invest
in new plants and equipment.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:55.861
I also want to eliminate all
capital gains taxes on small

00:01:55.861 --> 00:01:59.461
business investment, and help
small businesses to get the

00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:04.761
loans they need to open their doors and expand their operations.

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:08.361
But as we work to create jobs,
it is critical that we rein in

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.227
the budget deficits we've been
accumulating for far too long --

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:15.161
deficits that won't just burden
our children and grandchildren,

00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:18.528
but could damage our markets,
drive up our interest rates,

00:02:18.528 --> 00:02:21.861
and jeopardize our
recovery right now.

00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:23.828
There are certain core
principles our families and

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:27.061
businesses follow when they sit
down to do their own budgets.

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.861
They accept that they can't get
everything they want and they

00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:31.994
focus on what they really need.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:35.361
They make tough decisions
and sacrifice for their kids.

00:02:35.361 --> 00:02:37.328
They don't spend
what they don't have,

00:02:37.328 --> 00:02:39.861
and they make do with
what they've got.

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.428
It's time their
government did the same.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:44.895
That's why I'm pleased that the
Senate has just restored the

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:48.828
pay-as-you-go law that was
in place back in the 1990s.

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:51.161
It's no coincidence that
we ended that decade with a

00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.561
$236 billion surplus.

00:02:54.561 --> 00:02:56.861
But then we did
away with PAYGO --

00:02:56.861 --> 00:03:01.294
and we ended the next decade
with a $1.3 trillion deficit.

00:03:01.294 --> 00:03:04.561
Reinstating this law will
help us get back on track,

00:03:04.561 --> 00:03:06.628
ensuring that every
time we spend,

00:03:06.628 --> 00:03:09.294
we find somewhere else to cut.

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.227
I've also proposed
a spending freeze,

00:03:11.227 --> 00:03:13.795
so that as we increase
investments in things we need,

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:16.328
like job creation and
middle class tax cuts --

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.561
we cut spending
on those we don't,

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:22.661
like tax cuts for oil companies
and investment fund managers,

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:27.394
and programs that are redundant,
obsolete, or simply ineffective.

00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:29.628
Spending related to
Medicare, Medicaid,

00:03:29.628 --> 00:03:32.094
and Social Security
will not be affected --

00:03:32.094 --> 00:03:34.161
and neither will
national security --

00:03:34.161 --> 00:03:38.127
but all other discretionary
government programs will.

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:41.928
Finally, I've called for a
bi-partisan Fiscal Commission --

00:03:41.928 --> 00:03:45.261
a panel of Democrats and
Republicans who would sit down

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:48.494
and hammer out concrete
deficit-reduction proposals by a

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:50.127
certain deadline.

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:52.628
Because we've heard plenty of
talk and a lot of yelling on TV

00:03:52.628 --> 00:03:55.761
about deficits, and it's now
time to come together and make

00:03:55.761 --> 00:04:00.061
the painful choices we need
to eliminate those deficits.

00:04:00.061 --> 00:04:03.895
This past week, 53 Democrats
and Republicans voted for this

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.728
commission in the Senate.

00:04:05.728 --> 00:04:08.994
But it failed when seven
Republicans who had co-sponsored

00:04:08.994 --> 00:04:13.294
this idea in the first place
suddenly decided to vote against it.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.428
Now, it's one thing to have an
honest difference of opinion

00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:16.761
about something.

00:04:16.761 --> 00:04:19.528
I will always respect those who
take a principled stand for what

00:04:19.528 --> 00:04:22.294
they believe, even if
I disagree with them.

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:25.828
But what I won't accept is
changing positions because it's

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:27.461
good politics.

00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:30.695
What I won't accept is
opposition for opposition's sake.

00:04:30.695 --> 00:04:33.127
We can't have a serious discussion and take meaningful

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:36.528
action to create jobs and
control our deficit if

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:38.994
politicians just do what's
necessary to win the next

00:04:38.994 --> 00:04:43.528
election instead of what's
best for the next generation.

00:04:43.528 --> 00:04:47.161
I'm eager and ready to work
with anyone who's serious about

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.594
solving the real problems facing
our people and our country.

00:04:50.594 --> 00:04:53.928
I welcome anyone who comes to
the table in good faith to help

00:04:53.928 --> 00:04:57.861
get our economy moving again and
fulfill this country's promise.

00:04:57.861 --> 00:05:00.328
That's why we were elected
in the first place.

00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:03.494
That's what the American
people expect and deserve.

00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:05.928
And that's what we must deliver.

00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:06.928
Thanks so much.
