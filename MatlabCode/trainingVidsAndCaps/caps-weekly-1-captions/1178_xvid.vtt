00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.200
The President:
This was a momentous
week for America.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.934
It was a week in which together,
we took bold new steps towards

00:00:14.934 --> 00:00:18.633
restoring economic security for
our middle class and rebuilding

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.433
a stronger foundation
for our future.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:24.066
It was a week in which some of
the change that generations have

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:29.000
hoped for and worked for finally
became reality in America.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.533
It began with the passage of
comprehensive health insurance

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.667
reform that will begin to end
the worst practices of the

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:38.533
insurance industry, rein in
our exploding deficits, and,

00:00:38.533 --> 00:00:41.433
over time, finally offer
millions of families and small

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.400
businesses quality,
affordable care --

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.266
and the security and peace
of mind that comes with it.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:50.500
And it ended with Congress
casting a final vote on another

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.033
piece of legislation that
accomplished what we've been

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:56.600
talking about for decades -- legislation that will reform our

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.800
student loan system and help us educate all Americans to compete

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000
and win in the 21st century.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Year after year, we've seen
billions of taxpayer dollars

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.800
handed out as subsidies to bankers and middlemen who handle

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400
federal student loans, when
that money should have gone to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.100
advancing the dreams of our
students and working families.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.467
And yet attempts to fix this
problem and reform this program

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.900
were thwarted by special
interests that fought tooth and

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.233
nail to preserve their
exclusive giveaway.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.967
But this time, we said,
we would be different.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.100
We said we'd stand up to
the special interests,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.133
and stand up for the interests
of students and families.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.867
That's what happened this week.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:38.200
I commend all the Senators and Representatives who did the right thing.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.133
This reform of federal student loan programs will save

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:45.433
taxpayers $68 billion
over the next decade.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.367
And with this legislation,
we're putting that money to use

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.367
achieving a goal I set for
America: by the end of this

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:54.300
decade, we will once again
have the highest proportion of

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.967
college graduates in the world.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.166
To make college more affordable
for millions of middle-class

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.433
Americans for whom the cost of
higher education has become an

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:05.600
unbearable burden, we're
expanding federal Pell Grants

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.166
for students: increasing them to
keep pace with inflation in the

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:13.467
coming years and putting the
program on a stronger financial footing.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.333
In total, we are doubling funding for the federal Pell

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.533
Grant program to help the
students who depend on it.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.834
To make sure our students don't
go broke just because they chose

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:24.800
to go to college, we're making
it easier for graduates to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.166
afford their student
loan payments.

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:31.066
Today, about 2 in 3 graduates
take out loans to pay for college.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:35.033
The average student ends up
with more than $23,000 in debt.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.767
So when this change
takes effect in 2014,

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:41.600
we'll cap a graduate's annual
student loan repayments at 10%

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.166
of his or her income.

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:46.667
To help an additional 5 million
Americans earn degrees and

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.467
certificates over
the next decade,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.734
we're revitalizing programming
at our community colleges --

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.000
the career pathways for millions
of dislocated workers and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.600
working families
across this country.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.467
These schools are
centers of learning;

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:02.200
where students young and old can
get the skills and technical

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.433
training they need for the
jobs of today and tomorrow.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.300
They're centers of
opportunity as well;

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.533
where we can forge partnerships between students and businesses

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:14.033
so that every community can
gain the workforce it needs.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.033
And they are vital to
our economic future.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.467
And to ensure that all our
students have every chance to

00:03:19.467 --> 00:03:23.033
live up to their full potential,
this legislation also increases

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.934
support for our Minority
Serving Institutions,

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.000
including our Historically Black
Colleges and Universities,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.433
to keep them as strong as
ever in this new century.

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.500
Education and health care.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.133
Two of the most important
pillars of a strong America grew

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.066
stronger this week.

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.767
These achievements don't
represent the end of our

00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:43.867
challenges; nor do they signify
the end of the work that faces

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:45.200
our country.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.967
But what they do represent
is real and major reform.

00:03:48.967 --> 00:03:53.300
What they show is that we're a
nation still capable of doing big things.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.367
What they prove is what's
possible when we can come

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.033
together to overcome the
politics of the moment;

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.100
push back on the
special interests;

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.166
and look beyond the next
election to do what's right for

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.066
the next generation.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:07.600
That's the spirit in which we
continue the work of tackling

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.533
our greatest common tasks
-- an economy rebuilt;

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:15.533
job creation revitalized;
an American Dream renewed --

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.266
for all people.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.433
Thank you.
