The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.934
I'm here in Colorado Springs,
visiting some of the devastating

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:12.633
fires that have been
taking place over the last

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.900
several days.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.300
As many of you have been
watching on television,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.633
entire communities
are under threat.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.333
And we had a chance to tour some
of the devastation that has been

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:26.000
taking place in some of
the subdivisions here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.633
Firefighters are working 18
hours a day, around the clock,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.967
trying to make sure that they
get this blaze under control.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.166
We've got volunteers who are out
here who are making sure that

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:40.800
these firefighters have the
food and the water and all the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.367
resources that they need.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:45.467
And we've been engaging in
some unprecedented coordination

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.700
between federal, state, and
local communities to try to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.533
bring this fire under control.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.467
And one of the things
I've done here,

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.934
in addition to saying thank
you to these firefighters,

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:59.734
is to let them know that all
of America has their back.

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:03.066
One of the things that happens,
whether it's a fire here in

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:07.266
Colorado, or a tornado
in Alabama or Missouri,

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.533
or a flood or a
hurricane in Florida,

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:14.166
one of the things that happens
here in America is when we see

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:17.767
our fellow citizens in
trouble and having difficulty,

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:21.767
we come together as one American
family, as one community.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.266
And you see that spirit and
you see that strength here in

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:29.834
Colorado Springs, where
people are working together,

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.467
promising each other to rebuild.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.967
We've got to make sure that we
are there with them every step

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:37.867
of the way, even after
this fire is put out.

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:41.100
So for those of you who
can provide some help,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.233
you should get on the online
site of the American Red Cross.

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:46.367
They're very active in this
community and you can make your

00:01:46.367 --> 00:01:47.867
contributions there.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:51.133
We're going to continue to make
sure that the Federal Emergency

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:54.233
Management Agency,
the Forest Service,

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:57.166
our military and National Guard
and all the resources that we

00:01:57.166 --> 00:02:01.133
have available at the federal
level are brought to bear in

00:02:01.133 --> 00:02:02.567
fighting this fire.

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.967
This is a good reminder of
what makes us Americans.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:06.900
We don't just look
out for ourselves;

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.734
we look out for each other.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:13.000
And one of the things that I
told these firefighters is that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.700
we can provide them all
the resources they need,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
but only they provide the
courage and the discipline to be

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.266
able to actually
fight these fires.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:26.500
And it's important that we
appreciate what they do not just

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
when our own communities
are struck by disaster.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.800
It's important that we remember
what they do each and every

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.967
single day, and that we continue
to provide support to our first

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.834
responders, our emergency
management folks,

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:41.333
our firefighters,
our military --

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:46.000
everybody who helps secure our
liberty and our security each

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and every day.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.667
So, America, I hope you guys
remember the folks during these

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:51.800
times of need.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.066
I know this is a
little bit unusual --

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.700
we don't usually do weekly
addresses like this,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.533
but I thought it was a good
opportunity for us to actually

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:01.333
focus attention on a problem
that's going on here in

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:02.700
Colorado Springs.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.867
We never know when it might be
our community that's threatened,

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:06.800
and it's important that
we're there for them.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800
All right?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800
Thank you very much.
