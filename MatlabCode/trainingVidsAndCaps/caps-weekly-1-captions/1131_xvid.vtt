00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.967
The President:
The other week, men and women
across California opened up

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.934
their mailboxes to find a
letter from Anthem Blue Cross.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.367
The news inside
was jaw-dropping.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.433
Anthem was alerting almost a
million of its customers that it

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:22.333
would be raising premiums
by an average of 25%,

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.734
with about a quarter of folks
likely to see their rates go up

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:28.734
by anywhere from 35 to 39%.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:31.734
Now, after their announcement
stirred public outcry,

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:35.166
Anthem agreed to delay their
rate hike until May 1st while

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.333
the situation is reviewed
by the state of California.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.233
But it's not just Californians
who are being hit by rate hikes.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:46.400
In Kansas, one insurance company
raised premiums by 10 to 20%

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.600
only after asking to
raise them by 20 to 30%.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.233
Last year, Michigan Blue Cross
Blue Shield raised rates by 22%

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.166
after asking to raise
them by up to 56%.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.867
And in Maine, Anthem is asking
to raise rates for some folks by

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:05.467
about 23%.

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.967
The bottom line is that the
status quo is good for the

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.100
insurance industry
and bad for America.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.500
Over the past year, as families
and small business owners have

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.000
struggled to pay soaring
health care costs,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.600
and as millions of Americans
lost their coverage,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.233
the five largest insurers made
record profits of over $12 billion.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:28.567
And as bad as things are today,
they'll only get worse if we

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.200
fail to act.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
We'll see more and more
Americans go without the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.533
coverage they need.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.600
We'll see exploding premiums and
out-of-pocket costs burn through

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.066
more and more family budgets.

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:42.500
We'll see more and more small
businesses scale back benefits,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.867
drop coverage, or close down
because they can't keep up with

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.433
rising rates.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:50.367
And in time, we'll see these
skyrocketing health care costs

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:54.667
become the single largest
driver of our federal deficits.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.967
That's what the future
is on track to look like.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.700
But it's not what the
future has to look like.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.533
The question, then, is whether
we will do what it takes,

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.033
all of us -- Democrats
and Republicans --

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.033
to build a better future
for ourselves, our children,

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.700
and our country.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.700
That's why, next week, I'm
inviting members of both parties

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900
to take part in a bipartisan
health care meeting,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.800
and I hope they come in
a spirit of good faith.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.400
I don't want to see this meeting
turn into political theater,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.233
with each side simply reciting
talking points and trying to

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.100
score political points.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.600
Instead, I ask members of both
parties to seek common ground in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.633
an effort to solve a problem
that's been with us for generations.

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:36.700
It's in that spirit that
I've sought out and supported

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.800
Republican ideas on reform
from the very beginning.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.834
Some Republicans want to allow
Americans to purchase insurance

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:45.500
from a company in another state
to give people more choices and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.433
bring down costs.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.700
Some Republicans have also
suggested giving small

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.767
businesses the power to pool
together and offer health care

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.800
at lower prices, just as big
companies and labor unions do.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.834
I think both of these
are good ideas --

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.767
so long as we pursue them in
a way that protects benefits,

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:05.033
protects patients, and
protects the American people.

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.900
I hope Democrats and Republicans
can come together next week

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.533
around these and other ideas.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.367
To members of Congress,
I would simply say this.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.533
We know the American people
want us to reform our health

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:16.934
insurance system.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.600
We know where the broad
areas of agreement are.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.233
And we know where the
sources of disagreement lie.

00:03:23.233 --> 00:03:27.000
After debating this issue
exhaustively for a year,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.867
let's move forward together.

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:30.867
Next week is our chance to
finally reform our health

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:35.100
insurance system so it works for
families and small businesses.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.600
It's our chance to finally give
Americans the peace of mind of

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.233
knowing that they'll be able to
have affordable coverage when

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.200
they need it most.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.700
What's being tested here is not
just our ability to solve this

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.700
one problem, but our ability
to solve any problem.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.367
Right now, Americans are
understandably despairing about

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.100
whether partisanship and the
undue influence of special

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.266
interests in Washington will
make it impossible for us to

00:03:58.266 --> 00:04:01.633
deal with the big challenges
that face our country.

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.700
They want to see us focus
not on scoring points,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.066
but on solving problems; not
on the next election but on the

00:04:08.066 --> 00:04:09.667
next generation.

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:13.367
That's what we can do, and that
is what we must do when we come

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:17.533
together for this bipartisan
health care meeting next week.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.800
Thank you, and have
a great weekend.
