The President:
This weekend, as we
celebrate Memorial Day,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.867
families across America will
gather in backyards and front

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.200
porches, fire up the barbeque,
kick back with friends,

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.834
and spend time with
people they care about.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.533
That's as it should be.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.533
But I also hope
that as you do so,

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.600
you take some time to reflect on what Memorial Day is all about;

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.166
on why we set this day aside as a time of national remembrance.

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:32.033
It's fitting every day to pay
tribute to the men and women who

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.867
wear the uniform of the
United States of America.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.567
Still, there are certain days
that have been set aside for all

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.266
of us to do so.

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.967
Veterans Day is one such day -- when we are called to honor

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:45.600
Americans who've fought
under our country's flag.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.033
Our calling on Memorial
Day is different.

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:50.567
On this day, we honor not just
those who've worn this country's

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:54.567
uniform, but the men and women
who've died in its service,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.900
who've laid down their lives
in defense of their fellow

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.633
citizens; who've given their
last full measure of devotion to

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.166
protect the United
States of America.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.100
These are the men and women
I'll be honoring this weekend,

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.633
and I know many of you
are doing the same.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.934
There are any number of reasons
America emerged from its humble

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:13.433
beginnings as a cluster of
colonies to become the most

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:16.667
prosperous, most
powerful nation on earth.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.033
There is the hard
work, the resilience,

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:21.734
the character of our people; there is the ingenuity and

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:25.000
enterprising spirit of our entrepreneurs and innovators.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.367
There are the ideals of
opportunity, equality,

00:01:27.367 --> 00:01:30.033
and freedom that have not only
inspired our people to perfect

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:34.734
our own union, but inspired others to perfect theirs as well.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.900
But from the very start,
there was something more.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.600
A steadfast commitment to serve,
to fight, and if necessary,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.467
to die, to preserve America and
advance the ideals we cherish.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.367
It's a commitment witnessed at
each defining moment along the

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.300
journey of this country.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.567
It's what led a rag-tag militia
to face British soldiers at

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.633
Lexington and Concord.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:01:59.767
It's what led young men, in a
country divided half slave and

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:03.333
half free, to take up
arms to save our union.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.767
It's what led patriots in each
generation to sacrifice their

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.300
own lives to secure
the life of our nation,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.333
from the trenches of World War I
to the battles of World War II,

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:17.400
from Inchon and Khe Sanh,
to Mosul and Marjah.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.000
That commitment -- that willingness to lay down their

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.667
lives so we might inherit the blessings of this nation --

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:25.300
is what we honor today.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.800
But on this Memorial
Day, as on every day,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.767
we're called to honor their
ultimate sacrifice with more than words.

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.233
We're called to honor
them with deeds.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.567
We're called to honor them by
doing our part for the loved

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.133
ones our fallen heroes
have left behind --

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.367
looking after our
military families.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.867
By making sure the men and women
serving this country around the

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:46.767
world have the support they need
to achieve their mission and

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.467
come home safely.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:52.066
By making sure veterans have the
care and assistance they need.

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.533
In short, by serving all those
who have ever worn the uniform

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:58.133
of this country --
and their families --

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.834
as well as they have served us.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:05.934
On April 25, 1866, about a year
after the Civil War ended,

00:03:05.934 --> 00:03:08.300
a group of women visited
a cemetery in Columbus

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.266
Mississippi, to place flowers
by the graves of Confederate

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:14.533
soldiers who had
fallen at Shiloh.

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:17.133
As they did, they noticed
other graves nearby,

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.000
belonging to Union dead.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.834
But no one had come
to visit those graves,

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:22.900
or place a flower there.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.567
So they decided to lay a few
stems for those men too,

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:29.834
in recognition not of a fallen
Confederate or a fallen Union

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.633
soldier, but a fallen American.

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:34.734
A few years later, an
organization of Civil War

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.734
veterans established
what became Memorial Day,

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:42.533
selecting a date that coincided
with the time when flowers were in bloom.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.600
So this weekend, as we
commemorate Memorial Day,

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.300
I ask you to hold all our
fallen heroes in your hearts,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.600
and if you can, lay a flower
where they've come to rest.
