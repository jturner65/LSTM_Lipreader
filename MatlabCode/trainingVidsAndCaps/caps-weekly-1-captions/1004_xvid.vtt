00:00:05.496 --> 00:00:08.476
Two years ago, we set out on
a journey to change the way

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:10.326
that Washington works.

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.516
We sought a government that
served not the interests

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:15.006
of powerful lobbyists
or the wealthiest few,

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.346
but the middle-class
Americans I met every day

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:19.846
in every community along
the campaign trail -

00:00:19.846 --> 00:00:23.056
responsible men and women who
are working harder than ever,

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.206
worrying about their
jobs, and struggling

00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:26.896
to raise their families.

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:29.216
In so many town
halls and backyards,

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:31.066
they spoke of their
hopes for a government

00:00:31.066 --> 00:00:32.856
that finally confronts
the challenges

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:35.646
that their families face
every day; a government

00:00:35.646 --> 00:00:38.336
that treats their tax
dollars as responsibly

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:41.456
as they treat their own
hard-earned paychecks.

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:44.546
That is the change I promised
as a candidate for president.

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:48.206
It is the change the American
people voted for in November.

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:49.876
And it is the change
represented

00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:52.626
by the budget I sent
to Congress this week.

00:00:52.626 --> 00:00:55.686
During the campaign, I promised
a fair and balanced tax code

00:00:55.686 --> 00:00:59.466
that would cut taxes for
95% of working Americans,

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.416
roll back the tax
breaks for those making

00:01:01.416 --> 00:01:06.156
over $250,000 a year, and end
the tax breaks for corporations

00:01:06.156 --> 00:01:08.446
that ship our jobs overseas.

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:10.206
This budget does that.

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:13.246
I promised an economy run
on clean, renewable energy

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:16.216
that will create new American
jobs, new American industries,

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:19.396
and free us from the
dangerous grip of foreign oil.

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:21.276
This budget puts
us on that path,

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:23.896
through a market-based
cap on carbon pollution

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:27.326
that will make renewable energy
the profitable kind of energy;

00:01:27.326 --> 00:01:29.916
through investments in
wind power and solar power;

00:01:29.916 --> 00:01:32.406
advanced biofuels, clean coal,

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:34.556
and more fuel-efficient
American cars

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:36.336
and American trucks.

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:39.736
I promised to bring down the
crushing cost of health care -

00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:43.526
a cost that bankrupts one
American every thirty seconds,

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:45.916
forces small businesses
to close their doors,

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:48.556
and saddles our
government with more debt.

00:01:48.556 --> 00:01:51.746
This budget keeps that promise,
with a historic commitment

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:55.046
to reform that will lead
to lower costs and quality,

00:01:55.046 --> 00:01:58.376
affordable health care
for every American.

00:01:58.376 --> 00:02:00.346
I promised an education system

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:02.986
that will prepare every
American to compete,

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:06.526
so Americans can win
in a global economy.

00:02:06.526 --> 00:02:09.446
This budget will help us meet
that goal, with new incentives

00:02:09.446 --> 00:02:12.386
for teacher performance and
pathways for advancement;

00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:15.376
new tax credits that will make
college more affordable for all

00:02:15.376 --> 00:02:19.326
who want to go; and new
support to ensure that those

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:21.556
who do go finish their degree.

00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:23.896
This budget also
reflects the stark reality

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:27.036
of what we've inherited -
a trillion dollar deficit,

00:02:27.036 --> 00:02:30.766
a financial crisis,
and a costly recession.

00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:33.876
Given this reality, we'll have
to be more vigilant than ever

00:02:33.876 --> 00:02:36.716
in eliminating the programs
we don't need in order

00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:39.026
to make room for the
investments we do need.

00:02:39.026 --> 00:02:42.856
I promised to do this by going
through the federal budget page

00:02:42.856 --> 00:02:45.216
by page, and line by line.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:47.846
That is a process we have
already begun, and I am pleased

00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:50.726
to say that we've already
identified two trillion dollars

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:54.076
worth of deficit-reductions
over the next decade.

00:02:54.076 --> 00:02:56.946
We've also restored a sense
of honesty and transparency

00:02:56.946 --> 00:03:00.296
to our budget, which is why
this one accounts for spending

00:03:00.296 --> 00:03:04.026
that was hidden or left
out under the old rules.

00:03:04.026 --> 00:03:07.016
I realize that passing
this budget won't be easy.

00:03:07.016 --> 00:03:09.556
Because it represents
real and dramatic change,

00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:13.016
it also represents a threat to
the status quo in Washington.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:15.426
I know that the insurance
industry won't like the idea

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:17.226
that they'll have
to bid competitively

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.416
to continue offering
Medicare coverage,

00:03:19.416 --> 00:03:22.326
but that's how we'll help
preserve and protect Medicare

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:25.756
and lower health care costs
for American families.

00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:28.066
I know that banks and
big student lenders won't

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:31.376
like the idea that we're ending
their huge taxpayer subsidies,

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:34.766
but that's how we'll save
taxpayers nearly $50 billion

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:37.136
and make college
more affordable.

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:38.896
I know that oil and
gas companies won't

00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:42.446
like us ending nearly $30
billion in tax breaks,

00:03:42.446 --> 00:03:45.526
but that's how we'll help fund
a renewable energy economy

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.976
that will create new
jobs and new industries.

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:50.576
In other words, I know
these steps won't sit well

00:03:50.576 --> 00:03:53.026
with the special interests
and lobbyists who are invested

00:03:53.026 --> 00:03:54.886
in the old way of
doing business,

00:03:54.886 --> 00:03:58.076
and I know they're gearing
up for a fight as we speak.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:01.956
My message to them
is this: So am I.

00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:05.276
The system we have now
might work for the powerful

00:04:05.276 --> 00:04:07.636
and well-connected interests
that have run Washington

00:04:07.636 --> 00:04:10.366
for far too long, but I don't.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:11.946
I work for the American people.

00:04:11.946 --> 00:04:14.846
I didn't come here to do the
same thing we've been doing

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:16.766
or to take small steps forward,

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:19.076
I came to provide
the sweeping change

00:04:19.076 --> 00:04:20.946
that this country
demanded when it went

00:04:20.946 --> 00:04:22.746
to the polls in November.

00:04:22.746 --> 00:04:25.336
That is the change this
budget starts to make,

00:04:25.336 --> 00:04:27.056
and that is the
change I'll be fighting

00:04:27.056 --> 00:04:30.796
for in the weeks ahead - change
that will grow our economy,

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:34.426
expand our middle-class, and
keep the American Dream alive

00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:37.826
for all those men and women who
have believed in this journey

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:39.756
from the day it began.

00:04:39.806 --> 00:04:42.806
Thanks for listening.
