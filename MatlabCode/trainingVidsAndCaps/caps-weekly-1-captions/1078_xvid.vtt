00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.633
The President:
Over the past few weeks, as
we've debated reforms to hold

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.066
Wall Street accountable and
protect consumers and small

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.767
businesses in our
financial system,

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:16.500
we've come face-to-face with the
great power of special interests

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.100
in the workings
of our democracy.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.900
Of course, this
isn't a surprise.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.300
Every time a major issue arises,
we've come to expect that an

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.066
army of lobbyists will descend
on Capitol Hill in the hopes of

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.633
tilting the laws in their favor.

00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:32.633
That's one of the reasons I
ran for President: because I

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:35.567
believed so strongly that the
voices of ordinary Americans

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:40.066
were being drowned out by the
clamor of a privileged few in Washington.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:42.166
And that's why, since
the day I took office,

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:46.200
my administration has been
taking steps to reform the system.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.433
Recently, however, the Supreme
Court issued a decision that

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.433
overturned decades of
law and precedent --

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:57.066
dealing a huge blow to our
efforts to rein in this undue influence.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.166
In short, this decision gives
corporations and other special

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.900
interests the power to spend
unlimited amounts of money --

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.867
literally millions of dollars -- to affect elections throughout

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.333
our country.

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.533
This, in turn, will multiply
their influence over

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.066
decision-making
in our government.

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.734
In the starkest terms,
members will know --

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.600
when pressured by lobbyists -- that if they dare to oppose that

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.166
lobbyist's client, they could face an onslaught of negative

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:25.333
advertisement in the run
up to their next election.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.166
And corporations will be allowed
to run these ads without ever

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.600
having to tell voters exactly
who is paying for them.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.734
At a time when the American
people are already being

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:36.200
overpowered in Washington
by these forces,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.100
this will be a new and even more
powerful weapon that the special

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.834
interests will wield.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:45.433
In fact, it's exactly this kind
of vast power that led a great

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:48.066
Republican President
-- Teddy Roosevelt --

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.734
to tackle this
issue a century ago.

00:01:50.734 --> 00:01:53.700
He warned of the dangers of
limitless corporate spending in

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.200
our political system.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.834
He actually called it "one
of the principal sources of

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.266
corruption in our
political affairs."

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.834
And he proposed strict limits
on corporate influence in elections.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:07.033
"[E]very special interest is
entitled to justice," he said.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.333
"[B]ut not one is entitled
to a vote in Congress,

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:15.934
to a voice on the bench, or to
representation in any public office."

00:02:15.934 --> 00:02:17.967
In the wake of the recent
Supreme Court ruling,

00:02:17.967 --> 00:02:20.033
we face a similar challenge.

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.600
That's why it's so important
that Congress consider new

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.033
reforms to prevent corporations
and other special interests from

00:02:26.033 --> 00:02:28.734
gaining even more
clout in Washington.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.600
And almost all of these reforms
are designed to bring new

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.333
transparency to
campaign spending.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.266
They're based on the principle
espoused by former Supreme Court

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:42.367
Justice Louis Brandeis --
that sunlight is the best disinfectant.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.233
Shadowy campaign committees
would have to reveal who's

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.600
funding their activities
to the American people.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.000
And when corporations and other
special interests take to the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.233
airwaves, whoever is running and
funding the ad would have to

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:58.300
appear in the advertisement and
claim responsibility for it --

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.200
like a company's CEO or
an organization's biggest contributor.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.867
This will mean citizens can
evaluate the claims in these ads

00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:09.600
with information about an
organization's real motives.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.400
We know how important this is.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000
We've all seen groups with
benign-seeming names sponsoring

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.834
television commercials that
make accusations and assertions

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:21.700
designed to influence the public
debate and sway voters' minds.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.266
Now, of course every organization has every right in

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.600
this country to make
their voices heard.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.300
But the American people also
have the right to know when some

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.533
group like "Citizens for a
Better Future" is actually

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:38.600
funded entirely by "Corporations
for Weaker Oversight."

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.233
In addition, these reforms would
address another troubling aspect

00:03:42.233 --> 00:03:44.233
of the Supreme Court's ruling.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.333
Under the bill
Congress will consider,

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:48.767
we'll make sure that foreign
corporations and foreign

00:03:48.767 --> 00:03:52.166
nationals are restricted from
spending money to influence

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:55.300
American elections, just
as they were in the past --

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.734
even through U.S. subsidiaries.

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:01.300
And we'll keep large contractors
that receive taxpayer funds from

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.567
interfering in our
elections as well,

00:04:03.567 --> 00:04:06.166
to avoid the appearance of
corruption and the possible

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:08.400
misuse of tax dollars.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.834
Now, we can expect that these
proposed changes will be met

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.633
with heavy resistance from the
special interests and their

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:16.500
supporters in Congress.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.500
But I'm calling on leaders in
both parties to resist these pressures.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.266
For what we are facing is no
less than a potential corporate

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.400
takeover of our elections.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.867
And what is at stake is no
less than the integrity of our democracy.

00:04:29.867 --> 00:04:32.800
This shouldn't be a Democratic
issue or a Republican issue.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.734
This is an issue that goes to
whether or not we will have a

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.667
government that works for
ordinary Americans --

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.066
a government of, by,
and for the people.

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:44.567
That's why these reforms
are so important.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:48.200
And that's why I'm going to
fight to see them passed into law.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.433
Thanks so much.
