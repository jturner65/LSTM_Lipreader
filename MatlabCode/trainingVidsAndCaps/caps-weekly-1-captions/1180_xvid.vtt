00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.934
The President:
On Thursday, I paid a visit to
a small business in Buffalo,

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:12.533
New York, a town that's been
hard hit in recent decades.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:14.700
I heard from folks about the
struggles they've been facing

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.834
for longer than they
care to remember.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.133
And I talked with them about
what my administration is doing

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.700
to help our families,
our small businesses,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.133
and our economy rebound
from this recession.

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:28.066
Jumpstarting job creation in the
private sector and fostering a

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.000
climate that encourages
businesses to hire again is

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
vitally important -- and I'll continue working hard to make

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.433
sure that happens.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.967
But my responsibility as
President isn't just to help our

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.500
economy rebound from
this recession --

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400
it's to make sure an economic
crisis like the one that helped

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.200
trigger this recession
never happens again.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.033
That's what Wall Street
reform will help us do.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:52.367
In recent weeks, there's been a
lot of back and forth about the

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.500
reform bill currently making
its way through Congress.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
There's been a lot of discussion
about technical aspects of the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.166
bill, and a lot of heated -- and frankly, sometimes misleading --

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.033
rhetoric coming from
opponents of reform.

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:08.100
All of this has helped obscure
what reform would actually mean

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.300
for you, the American people.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.100
So, I just wanted to take a few
minutes to talk about why every

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.667
American has a stake
in Wall Street reform.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.967
First and foremost, you have a
stake in it if you've ever been

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:21.867
treated unfairly by a
credit card company,

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:24.400
misled by pages and
pages of fine print,

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.333
or ended up paying fees and
penalties you'd never heard of before.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.867
And you have a stake in it if
you've ever tried to take out a

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.934
home loan, a car loan,
or a student loan,

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.567
and been targeted by the
predatory practices of

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.834
unscrupulous lenders.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.033
The Wall Street reform bill
in Congress represents the

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:45.100
strongest consumer financial
protections in history.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.200
You'll be empowered with the
clear and concise information

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.800
you need to make the choices
that are best for you.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.834
We'll help stop
predatory practices,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:57.734
and curb unscrupulous lenders,
helping secure your family's

00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:59.300
financial future.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.633
That's why families
have a stake in it.

00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:04.934
And our community banks also
have a stake in reform.

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:07.600
These are banks we count on to
provide the capital that lets

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.400
our small businesses
hire and grow.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.233
The way the system
is currently set up,

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.567
these banks are at a
disadvantage because while they

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.100
often play by the rules,
many of their less scrupulous

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.834
competitors are not
playing by the rules.

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:24.100
So, what reform will do is help
level the playing field by

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.433
making sure all of our lenders -- not just community banks --

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:29.967
are subject to tough oversight.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:31.800
That's good news for
our community banks,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.533
which is why we've received
letters from some of these banks

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.533
in support of reform.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.000
What's true for our community
banks is also true for small

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.100
businessmen and women like
the ones I met in Buffalo.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.600
These small businesses were some
of the worst victims of the

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.467
excessive risk-taking on Wall
Street that led to this crisis.

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.033
Their credit dried up.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:51.834
They had to let people go.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.100
Some even shut their
doors altogether.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.834
And unless we put in
place real safeguards,

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:59.400
we could see it
happen all over again.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.100
That's why Wall Street
reform is so important.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.166
With reform, we'll make
our financial system more

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:07.166
transparent by bringing
the kinds of complex,

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:09.834
backroom deals that helped
trigger this crisis into the

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.367
light of day.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:14.500
We'll prevent banks from
taking on so much risk that --

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.633
could collapse and
threaten our entire economy.

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.834
And we'll give shareholders more
of a say on pay to help change

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:24.633
the perverse incentives that
encouraged reckless risk-taking

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:26.400
in the first place.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.934
Put simply, Wall Street reform
will bring greater security to

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.633
folks on Main Street.

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:34.333
The stories I heard in Buffalo
this week were a reminder that,

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:37.934
despite the progress we've made,
we need to keep working hard,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.934
so we can build on that progress
and rebound from this recession

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:42.333
in the short-term.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.400
But even as we do, we also need
to lay a new foundation for

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.133
growth and shared prosperity
over the long-term.

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:54.033
Next week, we have a chance to
help lay a cornerstone in that foundation.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.100
The reform bill being debated in
the Senate will not solve every

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.533
problem in our financial
system -- no bill could.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:03.066
But what this strong bill
will do is important,

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:06.033
and I urge the Senate to
pass it as soon as possible,

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:10.200
so we can secure America's
economic future in the 21st century.
