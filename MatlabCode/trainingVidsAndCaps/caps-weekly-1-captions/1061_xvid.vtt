00:00:08.386 --> 00:00:10.152
The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:12.052
As I know you've noticed
over the past few weeks,

00:00:12.052 --> 00:00:15.586
the price at your local pump
has been going up and up.

00:00:15.586 --> 00:00:17.085
And because it's
an election year,

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:20.252
so has the temperature of
our political rhetoric.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.719
What matters most to me right
now is the impact that rising

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:25.919
prices have on you.

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:27.419
When you've got to
spend more on gas,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:30.185
you've got less to spend
on everything else.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:31.719
It makes things harder.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.052
So I wanted to take a minute
this weekend to explain what

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:37.452
steps my Administration is
taking when it comes to energy

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:40.753
-- most importantly,
producing more of it while using

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:42.719
less of it.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.519
The truth is: the price of gas
depends on a lot of factors that

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.786
are often beyond our control.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:51.286
Unrest in the Middle East can
tighten global oil supply.

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:54.653
Growing nations like China or
India adding cars to the road

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.653
increases demand.

00:00:56.653 --> 00:01:00.252
But one thing we should control
is fraud and manipulation that

00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:02.586
can cause prices to
spike even further.

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:05.552
For years, traders at financial
firms were able to game the

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:08.352
energy markets, distort
the price of oil,

00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:11.653
and make big profits for
themselves at your expense.

00:01:11.653 --> 00:01:14.286
And they were able to do all
that because of major gaps and

00:01:14.286 --> 00:01:16.819
loopholes in our regulations.

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.853
When I took office, we
did something about it.

00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:22.886
The Wall Street reforms I signed
into law are helping bring

00:01:22.886 --> 00:01:25.452
energy markets out of
the shadows and under

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.286
real oversight.

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:29.985
They're strengthening our
ability to go after fraud and to

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.352
prevent traders from
manipulating the market.

00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:36.586
So it's not just wrong, but
dangerous that some in Congress

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:39.519
want to roll back those
protections and return to the

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.519
days when companies like Enron
could avoid regulation and reap

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.352
enormous profits, no
matter who it hurt.

00:01:45.352 --> 00:01:48.119
What's more, at a time when big
oil companies are making more

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.886
money than ever before, we're
still giving them $4 billion of

00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:55.119
your tax dollars in
subsidies every year.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.952
Your member of Congress
should be fighting for you.

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.886
Not for big financial firms.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.252
Not for big oil companies.

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:04.152
In the next few weeks, I expect
Congress to vote on ending

00:02:04.152 --> 00:02:05.619
these subsidies.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.252
And when they do, we're going
to put every single Member of

00:02:08.252 --> 00:02:11.686
Congress on record: They can
either stand up for the oil

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:15.219
companies, or they can stand
up for the American people.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.286
They can either place their bets
on a fossil fuel from the last

00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:22.419
century, or they can place
their bets on America's future.

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:24.219
So make your voice heard.

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.152
Send your
representative an email.

00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:27.619
Give them a call.

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.185
Tell them to stand with you.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:32.486
And tell them to
be honest with you.

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:36.486
It's easy to promise a quick
fix when it comes to gas prices.

00:02:36.486 --> 00:02:38.352
There just isn't one.

00:02:38.352 --> 00:02:40.319
Anyone who tells
you otherwise --

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.319
any career politician who
promises some three-point plan

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.819
for two-dollar gas -- they're
not looking for a solution.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.919
They're just looking
for your vote.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.352
If we're truly going to make
sure we're not at the mercy of

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:54.753
spikes in gas prices every year,
the answer isn't just going to

00:02:54.753 --> 00:02:58.286
be to drill more -- because
we're already drilling more.

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:01.052
Under my Administration, we're
producing more oil here at home

00:03:01.052 --> 00:03:05.185
than at any time in the last
eight years, that's a fact.

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.486
We've quadrupled the number of
operating oil rigs to a record

00:03:08.486 --> 00:03:11.052
high, that's a fact.

00:03:11.052 --> 00:03:15.985
And we've opened millions of
acres of land and offshore to

00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:19.352
develop more of our
domestic resources.

00:03:19.352 --> 00:03:21.519
Those are the facts.

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.352
We can't just rely on drilling.

00:03:24.352 --> 00:03:27.085
Not when we use more than
20% of the world's oil,

00:03:27.085 --> 00:03:30.886
but still only have 2% of the
world's known oil reserves.

00:03:30.886 --> 00:03:33.985
If we don't develop
other sources of energy,

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.486
and the technology
to use less energy,

00:03:36.486 --> 00:03:39.352
we'll continue to be dependent
on foreign countries for our

00:03:39.352 --> 00:03:40.886
energy needs.

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:44.085
That's why we're pursuing an
all-of-the-above strategy.

00:03:44.085 --> 00:03:48.052
As we develop more oil and gas,
we're also developing wind and

00:03:48.052 --> 00:03:52.352
solar power; biofuels, and
next-generation vehicles --

00:03:52.352 --> 00:03:56.219
and thousands of Americans have
jobs right now because of it.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.786
We need to keep making
those investments --

00:03:58.786 --> 00:04:00.586
because I don't want
to see those jobs go to

00:04:00.586 --> 00:04:01.952
other countries.

00:04:01.952 --> 00:04:04.719
I want to create even more of
them right here in the United

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.552
States of America.

00:04:06.552 --> 00:04:08.319
And after three
decades of inaction,

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.252
we raised fuel economy standards
so that by the middle of the

00:04:11.252 --> 00:04:14.619
next decade, our cars will
average nearly 55 miles

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.019
per gallon.

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.853
That's nearly double
what they get today.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:21.286
That means you'll only have to
fill up every two weeks instead

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:22.586
of every week.

00:04:22.586 --> 00:04:25.819
And that will save the typical
family more than $8,000 over the

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.985
life of the car --
just by using less gas.

00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:32.853
Combined, these steps have
helped put us on a path to

00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:35.085
greater energy independence.

00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:37.586
Since I took office, America's
dependence on foreign oil has

00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:40.286
gone down every single year.

00:04:40.286 --> 00:04:42.753
In 2010, for the first
time in 13 years,

00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:47.552
less than half the oil we used
came from foreign countries.

00:04:47.552 --> 00:04:49.319
But we can do even better.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.952
And we will.

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:54.119
What we can't do is keep
depending on other countries for

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:56.019
our energy needs.

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:58.919
In America we control
our own destiny.

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.052
And that's the choice we face
-- the past, or the future.

00:05:04.052 --> 00:05:07.085
America is what it is today
because we've always placed our

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.853
bets on the future.

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:11.786
Thanks, and have
a great weekend.
