00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.633
The President:
One of the reasons I ran for President was because I believed

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:11.800
so strongly that the voices
of everyday Americans,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.834
hardworking folks doing everything they can to stay

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.633
afloat, just weren't being heard over the powerful voices of the

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:19.834
special interests in Washington.

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.800
And the result was a national
agenda too often skewed in favor

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.934
of those with the power
to tilt the tables.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.400
In my first year in office, we
pushed back on that power by

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.500
implementing historic reforms
to get rid of the influence of

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.166
those special interests.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.867
On my first day in office,
we closed the revolving door

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.133
between lobbying firms and the
government so that no one in my

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.467
administration would make
decisions based on the interests

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.767
of former or future employers.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.300
We barred gifts from federal
lobbyists to executive

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.767
branch officials.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:53.433
We imposed tough restrictions to
prevent funds for our recovery

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:55.767
from lining the pockets
of the well-connected,

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.133
instead of creating
jobs for Americans.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.100
And for the first
time in history,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.233
we have publicly disclosed
the names of lobbyists and

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.233
non-lobbyists alike who visit
the White House every day,

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:09.200
so that you know what's going
on in the White House --

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
the people's house.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.533
We've been making
steady progress.

00:01:12.533 --> 00:01:15.233
But this week, the United States
Supreme Court handed a huge

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.967
victory to the special
interests and their lobbyists --

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:20.133
and a powerful blow to
our efforts to rein in

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.767
corporate influence.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:24.467
This ruling strikes at
our democracy itself.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.834
By a 5-4 vote, the Court
overturned more than a century

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:31.734
of law -- including a bipartisan
campaign finance law written by

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.734
Senators John McCain and
Russ Feingold that had barred

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.700
corporations from using their
financial clout to directly

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.934
interfere with elections by
running advertisements for or

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:44.266
against candidates in the
crucial closing weeks.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:47.934
This ruling opens the floodgates
for an unlimited amount of

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:50.667
special interest money
into our democracy.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:53.233
It gives the special interest
lobbyists new leverage to spend

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:56.367
millions on advertising to
persuade elected officials to

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.633
vote their way -- or to
punish those who don't.

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:02.200
That means that any public
servant who has the courage to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.834
stand up to the special
interests and stand up for the

00:02:04.834 --> 00:02:09.333
American people can find himself
or herself under assault come

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:10.700
election time.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.934
Even foreign corporations
can now get into the act.

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.967
I can't think of anything
more devastating to the

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:17.367
public interest.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:20.266
The last thing we need to do
is hand more influence to the

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:23.800
lobbyists in Washington, or more
power to the special interests

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.700
to tip the outcome of elections.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.934
All of us, regardless of party,
should be worried that it will

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:34.000
be that much harder to get fair,
common-sense financial reforms,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.467
or close unwarranted tax
loopholes that reward

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.934
corporations from sheltering
their income or shipping

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:40.967
American jobs off-shore.

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.266
It will make it more difficult
to pass commonsense laws to

00:02:43.266 --> 00:02:46.667
promote energy independence
because even foreign entities

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:49.734
would be allowed to
mix in our elections.

00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:51.567
It would give the health
insurance industry even more

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:55.767
leverage to fend off reforms
that would protect patients.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:59.467
We don't need to give any more
voice to the powerful interests

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:02.734
that already drown out the
voices of everyday Americans.

00:03:02.734 --> 00:03:04.367
And we don't intend to.

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.166
When this ruling came down, I
instructed my administration to

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.166
get to work immediately with
Members of Congress willing to

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:13.066
fight for the American
people to develop a forceful,

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.700
bipartisan response
to this decision.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.066
We've begun that work, and it will be a priority for us until

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:22.300
we repair the damage
that has been done.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.633
You know, one of the
great Republican Presidents,

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:27.734
Teddy Roosevelt, fought to limit
special interest spending and

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:31.266
influence over American
political campaigns and warned

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:34.667
of the impact of unbridled,
corporate spending.

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.266
His message rings as
true as ever today,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.000
in this age of mass
communications,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.233
when the decks are too
often stacked against

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.100
ordinary Americans.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.800
And as long as I'm
your President,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.633
I'll never stop fighting to
make sure that the most powerful

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.667
voice in Washington
belongs to you.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:51.667
Thanks.
