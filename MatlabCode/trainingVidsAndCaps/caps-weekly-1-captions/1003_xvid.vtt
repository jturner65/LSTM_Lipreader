00:00:05.836 --> 00:00:08.696
Earlier this week, I signed
into law the American Recovery

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:09.956
and Reinvestment Act --

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:13.706
the most sweeping economic
recovery plan in history.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:17.116
Because of this plan, 3.5
million Americans will now go

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:20.956
to work doing the work
that America needs done.

00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.876
I'm grateful to Congress,
governors and mayors

00:00:23.876 --> 00:00:25.346
across the country, and to all

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:28.656
of you whose support made
this critical step possible.

00:00:28.656 --> 00:00:30.356
Because of what
we did together,

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:33.916
there will now be shovels in
the ground, cranes in the air,

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:36.996
and workers rebuilding our
crumbling roads and bridges,

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:39.876
and repairing our
faulty levees and dams.

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.806
Because of what we did,
companies -- large and small --

00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:45.096
that produce renewable
energy can now apply

00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:49.116
for loan guarantees and tax
credits and find ways to grow,

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.866
instead of laying people off;

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:52.946
and families can lower
their energy bills

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:55.056
by weatherizing their homes.

00:00:55.056 --> 00:00:58.206
Because of what we did, our
children can now graduate

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:00.256
from 21st century schools

00:01:00.256 --> 00:01:04.196
and millions more can do what
was unaffordable just last week

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:06.396
-- and get their
college degree.

00:01:06.396 --> 00:01:08.526
Because of what we did,
lives will be saved

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.796
and health care
costs will be cut

00:01:10.796 --> 00:01:13.436
with new computerized
medical records.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:16.986
Because of what we did, there
will now be police on the beat,

00:01:16.986 --> 00:01:20.756
firefighters on the job, and
teachers preparing lesson plans

00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:21.946
who thought they
would not be able

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:24.596
to continue pursuing
their critical missions.

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:26.516
And ensure that
all of this is done

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:28.936
with an unprecedented
level of transparency

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:32.126
and accountability, I have
assigned a team of managers

00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.226
to make sure that precious tax
dollars are invested wisely

00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:37.986
and well.

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:38.836
Because of what we did,

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.736
95 percent of all working
families will get a tax cut --

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:45.576
in keeping with a promise
I made on the campaign.

00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:47.776
And I'm pleased to
announce that this morning,

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:50.276
the Treasury Department
began directing employers

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:53.756
to reduce the amount of taxes
withheld from paychecks --

00:01:53.756 --> 00:01:55.546
meaning that by April 1st,

00:01:55.546 --> 00:01:58.006
a typical family will
begin taking home

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.516
at least $65 more every month.

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:05.766
Never before in our history has
a tax cut taken effect faster

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:08.576
or gone to so many
hardworking Americans.

00:02:08.576 --> 00:02:11.016
But as important as it was that
I was able to sign this plan

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:14.026
into law, it is only a
first step on the road

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:15.596
to economic recovery.

00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:18.096
And we can't fail to
complete the journey.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.596
That will require stemming
the spread of foreclosures

00:02:20.596 --> 00:02:23.256
and falling home values,
and doing all we can

00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:26.186
to help responsible
homeowners stay in their homes,

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:28.706
which is exactly what the
housing plan I announced last

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:29.856
week will help us do.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:33.796
It will require stabilizing and
repairing our banking system,

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:35.246
and getting credit
flowing again

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:37.306
to families and businesses.

00:02:37.306 --> 00:02:40.356
It will require reforming
the broken regulatory system

00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:43.706
that made this crisis possible,
and recognizing that it's only

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:46.606
by setting and enforcing 21st
century rules of the road

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:49.516
that we can build
a thriving economy.

00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:51.436
And it will require
doing all we can

00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.516
to get exploding
deficits under control

00:02:53.516 --> 00:02:55.986
as our economy begins
to recover.

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:57.676
That work begins on Monday,

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:00.556
when I will convene a fiscal
summit of independent experts

00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:04.116
and unions, advocacy groups
and members of Congress,

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.056
to discuss how we can cut
the trillion-dollar deficit

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:08.826
that we've inherited.

00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:10.526
On Tuesday, I will
speak to the nation

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:12.646
about our urgent
national priorities.

00:03:12.646 --> 00:03:15.496
And on Thursday, I'll
release a budget that's sober

00:03:15.496 --> 00:03:18.426
in its assessments,
honest in its accounting,

00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:21.366
and lays out in detail
my strategy for investing

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:23.826
in what we need,
cutting what we don't,

00:03:23.826 --> 00:03:26.686
and restoring fiscal
discipline.

00:03:26.686 --> 00:03:29.996
No single piece of this
broad economic recovery can,

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:34.036
by itself, meet the demands
that have been placed on us.

00:03:34.036 --> 00:03:35.596
We can't help people find work

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:38.096
or pay their bills
unless we unlock credit

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:39.936
for families and businesses.

00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:43.336
We can't solve our housing
crisis unless we help people

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:47.376
find work so that they can
make payments on their homes.

00:03:47.376 --> 00:03:50.206
We can't produce shared
prosperity without firm rules

00:03:50.206 --> 00:03:53.576
of the road, and we can't
generate sustained growth

00:03:53.576 --> 00:03:56.766
without getting our
deficits under control.

00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:59.956
In short, we cannot
successfully address any

00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.396
of our problems without
addressing them all.

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:06.196
And that is exactly what the
strategy we are pursuing is

00:04:06.196 --> 00:04:08.146
designed to do.

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:09.416
None of this will be easy.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.686
The road ahead will be
long and full of hazards.

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.746
But I am confident that we,
as a people, have the strength

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:18.436
and wisdom to carry
out this strategy

00:04:18.436 --> 00:04:20.216
and overcome this crisis.

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:23.456
And if we do, our economy
-- and our country --

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:25.856
will be better and
stronger for it.

00:04:25.856 --> 00:04:28.856
Thank you.
