00:00:06.533 --> 00:00:09.033
The President:
Over the last week, my administration has taken several

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:13.967
precautions to address the
challenge posed by the 2009 H1N1

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:15.333
flu virus.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.834
Today, I'd like to take a few
minutes to explain why.

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:20.834
This is a new strain of the flu
virus,

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.600
and because we haven't developed
an immunity to it,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.333
it has more potential to cause
us harm.

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.900
Unlike the various strains of
animal flu that have emerged in

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.934
the past, it's a flu that's
spreading from human to human.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.400
This creates the potential for a
pandemic,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.767
which is why we are acting
quickly and aggressively.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:42.000
This H1N1 flu has had its
biggest impact in Mexico,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.066
where it's claimed a number of
lives and infected

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.667
hundreds more.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.567
Thus far, the strain in this
country that has infected people

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:53.266
in at least nineteen states has
not been as potent or as deadly.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.300
We can't know for certain why
that is,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.400
which is why we are taking all
necessary precautions in the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.133
event that the virus does turn
into something worse.

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.000
This is also why the Centers for
Disease Control has recommended

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.300
that schools and child care
facilities with confirmed cases

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.934
of the virus close for up to
fourteen days.

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:15.633
This is why we urge employers to
allow infected employees to take

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.533
as many sick days as necessary.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:20.333
If more schools are forced to
close,

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.333
we've also recommended that both
parents and businesses think

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:27.633
about contingency plans if
children do have to stay home.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:30.200
We've asked every American to
take the same steps you would

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.934
take to prevent any other flu:
keep your hands washed;

00:01:33.934 --> 00:01:36.867
cover your mouth when you cough;
stay home from work if you're

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.900
sick; and keep your children
home from school

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.200
if they're sick.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.400
The White House has launched pages in Facebook,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.500
MySpace, and Twitter to support
the ongoing efforts by the CDC

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.400
to update the public as quickly
and effectively as possible.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.433
And as our scientists and
researchers learn more

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.934
information about this virus
every day,

00:01:55.934 --> 00:01:58.700
the guidance we offer will
likely change.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.667
What will not change is the fact
that we'll be making every

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.934
recommendation based on the best
science possible.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.633
We will also continue investing
in every resource necessary to

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:12.500
treat this virus and prevent a
wider outbreak.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.367
The good news is that the
current strain of H1N1 can be

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:18.133
defeated by a course of
antiviral treatment that we

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:19.834
already have on hand.

00:02:19.834 --> 00:02:22.133
We began this week with 50
million courses of this

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.400
treatment in the Strategic
National Stockpile.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
Over the course of the last few
days,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.567
we've delivered one-quarter of that stockpile to states so that

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.400
they are prepared to treat
anyone who is infected with

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.133
this virus.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:38.166
We then purchased an additional
thirteen million treatments to

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.667
refill our strategic stockpile.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.233
Out of an abundance of caution,
I've also asked Congress for

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:48.333
$1.5 billion if it's needed to
purchase additional antivirals,

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:51.233
emergency equipment, and the
development of a vaccine that

00:02:51.233 --> 00:02:54.266
can prevent this virus as we
prepare for the next flu season

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:55.867
in the fall.

00:02:55.867 --> 00:02:58.400
The Recovery Act that Congress
enacted in February also

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.233
includes expansions of community
health centers,

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:03.500
a dramatic increase in the
training of health care workers

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.200
and nurses, and $300 million for
the development and deployment

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.867
of vaccines - all of which will
help us meet this threat.

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:13.633
Finally, thanks to the work that
the last administration and

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:17.033
Congress did to prepare for a
possible avian flu pandemic in

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.166
2005, states and the federal
government have fully operable

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.433
influenza readiness plans and
are better prepared to deal with

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.200
such a challenge than ever
before.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.266
It is my greatest hope and
prayer that all of these

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.500
precautions and preparations
prove unnecessary.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.100
But because we have it within
our power to limit the potential

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.266
damage of this virus, we have a
solemn and urgent responsibility

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:41.533
to take the necessary steps.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:45.333
I would sooner take action now
than hesitate and face graver

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.166
consequences later.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:50.433
I have no higher priority as
President of the United States

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:52.967
than the safety and security of
the American people,

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.834
and I will do whatever is necessary to protect

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.100
this country.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.700
So I want to thank every
American for their patience and

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.633
understanding during this
developing challenge,

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.000
and I promise that this
government will continue

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.467
speaking clearly and honestly
about the steps we're taking

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:08.967
to meet it.

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.033
Thank you.
