00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:11.552
The President:
Over the past two years, more than seven million Americans

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:14.486
have lost their jobs, and factories and businesses across

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.019
our country have been shuttered.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.753
In one way or another, we've
all been touched by the worst

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:22.486
economic downturn since
the Great Depression.

00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:25.219
The difficult steps we've taken
since January have helped to

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:29.019
break our fall, and begin
to get us back on our feet.

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:30.686
The economy's growing again.

00:00:30.686 --> 00:00:33.452
The flood of job losses we saw
at the beginning of this year

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:36.052
slowed to a relative
trickle last month.

00:00:36.052 --> 00:00:38.252
These are all good
signs for the future,

00:00:38.252 --> 00:00:40.853
but they're little comfort to all our neighbors who remain out

00:00:40.853 --> 00:00:42.152
of a job.

00:00:42.152 --> 00:00:44.919
And my solemn commitment
is to work every day,

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.819
in every way that I can, to push this recovery forward and build

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.419
a new foundation for our
lasting growth and prosperity.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.452
That's why I announced some
additional steps this week to

00:00:54.452 --> 00:00:56.619
spur private sector hiring.

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.853
We'll give an added boost to
small businesses across our

00:00:58.853 --> 00:01:02.152
nation through additional tax
cuts and access to lending they

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:04.085
desperately need to grow.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.853
We'll rebuild more of our vital
infrastructure and promote

00:01:06.853 --> 00:01:10.786
advanced manufacturing in clean
energy to put Americans to work

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:12.853
doing the work we need done.

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:14.786
And I've called for the extension of unemployment

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.786
insurance and health benefits
to help those who've lost their

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:22.252
jobs weather these storms until
we reach that brighter day.

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:25.319
But even as we dig our
way out of this deep hole,

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.985
it's important that we address
the irresponsibility and

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:32.119
recklessness that got us into
this mess in the first place.

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.719
Some of it was the result
of an era of easy credit,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.819
when millions of Americans
borrowed beyond their means,

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:39.452
bought homes they
couldn't afford,

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:42.419
and assumed that housing prices
would always rise and the day of

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:44.819
reckoning would never come.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.586
But much of it was due to
the irresponsibility of large

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:50.886
financial institutions on Wall
Street that gambled on risky

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:53.653
loans and complex
financial products,

00:01:53.653 --> 00:01:56.952
seeking short-term profits and
big bonuses with little regard

00:01:56.952 --> 00:01:59.119
for long-term consequences.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.653
It was, as some put it,
risk management without the management.

00:02:03.653 --> 00:02:06.619
And their actions, in the
absence of strong oversight,

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.486
intensified the cycle of
bubble-and-bust and led to a

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:13.886
financial crisis that threatened
to bring down the entire economy.

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:16.653
It was a disaster that could
have been avoided if we'd had

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:19.686
clearer rules of the road
for Wall Street and actually

00:02:19.686 --> 00:02:21.352
enforced them.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:23.319
We can't change that history.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.653
But we have an absolute
responsibility to learn from it,

00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:29.619
and take steps to prevent a
repeat of the crisis from which

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.419
we're still recovering.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.085
And that's why I've proposed a
series of financial reforms that

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:37.886
would target the abuses we've
seen and leave us less exposed

00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:40.586
to the kind of breakdown
we just experienced.

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.919
They would bring new
transparency and accountability

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.552
to the financial markets, so
that the kind of risky dealings

00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:50.552
that sparked the crisis would
be fully disclosed and properly regulated.

00:02:50.552 --> 00:02:53.052
They would give us the tools to
ensure that the failure of one

00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:56.319
large bank or financial
institution won't spread like a

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.085
virus throughout the
entire financial system.

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:01.719
Because we should never again
find ourselves in the position

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:05.219
in which our only choices are
bailing out banks or letting our

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.185
economy collapse.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:09.886
And they would consolidate the
consumer protection functions

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:13.219
currently spread across half a
dozen agencies and vest them in

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.586
a new Consumer Financial
Protection Agency.

00:03:16.586 --> 00:03:18.886
This agency would have the
authority to put an end to the

00:03:18.886 --> 00:03:22.753
misleading and dishonest
practices by banks and

00:03:22.753 --> 00:03:25.252
institutions that market
financial products like credit

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:29.786
cards and debit cards; mortgage and auto and payday loans.

00:03:29.786 --> 00:03:32.486
These are all commonsense reforms that respond to the

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:36.319
obvious problems exposed
by the financial crisis.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.919
But, as we've learned
so many times before,

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.819
common sense doesn't always
prevail in Washington.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.486
Just this week, Republican
leaders in the House summoned

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:48.286
more than 100 key lobbyists for
the financial industry to a "pep

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:52.219
rally," and urged them to
redouble their efforts to block

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.452
meaningful financial reform.

00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:56.719
Not that they needed
the encouragement.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.152
The industry has already
spent more than $300 million on

00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:03.386
lobbying to influence
the debate this year.

00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:05.853
The special interests and their
agents in Congress claim that

00:04:05.853 --> 00:04:09.152
reforms like the Consumer
Financial Protection Agency will

00:04:09.152 --> 00:04:12.552
stifle consumer choice and that
updated rules and oversight will

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.952
frustrate innovation in
the financial markets.

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:19.753
But Americans don't choose to be
victimized by mysterious fees,

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:23.952
and changing terms, and pages
and pages of fine print.

00:04:23.952 --> 00:04:26.019
And while innovation
should be encouraged,

00:04:26.019 --> 00:04:29.952
risky schemes that threaten
our entire economy should not.

00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:32.952
We can't afford to let the same
phony arguments and bad habits

00:04:32.952 --> 00:04:36.286
of Washington kill financial
reform and leave American

00:04:36.286 --> 00:04:40.185
consumers and our economy
vulnerable to another meltdown.

00:04:40.185 --> 00:04:43.486
Yesterday, the House passed
comprehensive reform legislation

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:46.519
that incorporates many of the
essential changes we need,

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:50.419
and the Senate Banking Committee
is working on its own package of reforms.

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:54.552
I urge both houses to act as
quickly as possible to pass real

00:04:54.552 --> 00:04:58.052
reform that restores free
and fair markets in which

00:04:58.052 --> 00:05:01.552
recklessness and greed are
thwarted; and hard work,

00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:04.952
responsibility, and
competition are rewarded --

00:05:04.952 --> 00:05:07.786
reforms that work for
businesses, investors,

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:09.619
and consumers alike.

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:13.119
That's how we'll keep our
economy and our institutions strong.

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:15.185
That's how we'll restore a
sense of responsibility and

00:05:15.185 --> 00:05:18.552
accountability to both
Wall Street and Washington.

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:20.786
And that's how we'll safeguard
everything the American people

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:24.519
are working so hard to build
-- a broad-based recovery;

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:28.519
lasting prosperity; and
a renewed American Dream.

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.519
Thanks.
