00:00:05.658 --> 00:00:07.558
The Vice President:
Hi, this is Joe Biden.

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:09.792
I'm speaking to you from the
University of Pittsburgh,

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:12.825
where I just spoke to students
here about what we've done to

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.525
help ease the burden on them
when it comes to the rising cost

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:20.325
of tuition and the accumulating
student debt and what we're

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:23.758
going to do to help create
jobs when they graduate.

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:26.658
You know, today we found out
we've had the 20th month in a

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:29.991
row where we've increased
private sector jobs --

00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:34.124
104,000 this month, 104,000
private sector jobs.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:36.525
And as all you know,
that's not nearly enough.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:38.058
We have to increase the pace.

00:00:38.058 --> 00:00:41.425
We have to act now to do
everything in our power to keep

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:44.558
this economy moving
and to grow jobs.

00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:47.858
President Obama is on his way
back from France where he just

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:51.825
met with the leaders of the 20
largest economies in the world,

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:55.058
where he urged our European
friends to step up and stabilize

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.925
their own economies
because if they fail,

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.158
it will affect the whole world.

00:01:00.158 --> 00:01:02.792
Too many Americans
are still struggling.

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:05.258
Too many college students here
at the University of Pittsburgh

00:01:05.258 --> 00:01:07.658
and elsewhere are worrying
about the rising cost of their

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:11.358
tuition, and the increasing
accumulation of debt.

00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:15.291
And too many of their parents
are in stagnant jobs or out of

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.758
work, wondering if they're going
to be able to send their child

00:01:17.758 --> 00:01:20.258
back to college next semester.

00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:21.991
My dad used to have a saying.

00:01:21.991 --> 00:01:25.091
He said, a job is about a
lot more than a paycheck.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:26.792
It's about dignity.

00:01:26.792 --> 00:01:28.325
It's about respect.

00:01:28.325 --> 00:01:31.224
And too many Americans have
been stripped of their dignity

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.591
through no fault of their own.

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.692
So we can't wait to help them.

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:39.625
The President and I
believe we have to act now.

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:42.358
That's why we've introduced
the jobs bill which independent

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:46.191
validators said would
create 2 million new jobs.

00:01:46.191 --> 00:01:48.558
Although 51 senators
voted for that jobs bill,

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:51.725
our Republican colleagues in
the Senate used a procedural

00:01:51.725 --> 00:01:56.191
requirement that requires it
to have 60 votes, so it failed.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:00.258
And since then we've taken every
important piece of the jobs bill

00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:03.058
and demanded that we
have a separate vote.

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:05.224
But our Republican colleagues
in the Senate have voted

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:08.825
unanimously to vote down
each and every part so far:

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:12.325
to restore 400,000 jobs for
teachers, police officers,

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:14.991
firefighters, putting
them back in classrooms,

00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:17.558
on the streets and
in the fire houses.

00:02:17.558 --> 00:02:20.124
And then on Thursday, they
unanimously voted down the

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:23.692
second part of our program: to
rebuild our crumbling roads and

00:02:23.692 --> 00:02:27.391
bridges, which would have
created more than 400,000

00:02:27.391 --> 00:02:29.558
good-paying jobs.

00:02:29.558 --> 00:02:31.725
These are all programs that the
Republicans in the past have

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:35.525
supported, but once again,
every Republican voted no --

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:39.591
blocking the majority will to
put these folks back to work.

00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.692
I think the assumption is
they're voting no because of the

00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:45.725
way we would pay for these
jobs, and they are paid for.

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:48.091
Well, we think everybody
should pay their fair share,

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:52.658
and that's why we added a small
surtax on the first dollar after

00:02:52.658 --> 00:02:56.958
a person makes his first
$1 million -- to pay for it.

00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.591
That seems fair to us.

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.758
It's a small price to pay to put
hundreds of thousands of people

00:03:01.758 --> 00:03:03.458
back to work.

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:04.325
So, look, we can't wait.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:07.892
We can't wait for the Congress
to start acting responsibly,

00:03:07.892 --> 00:03:09.958
and that's why the President
has begun to use his executive

00:03:09.958 --> 00:03:13.591
power and making announcements
like one that will put hundreds

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.625
of thousands of people -- will
be able to go and refinance

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:20.358
their homes from a 6%
interest they're paying to 4%,

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.391
which what the rate is now.

00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:25.091
That would save
them $2,000 a year.

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.892
That's why the President
announced that beginning next

00:03:27.892 --> 00:03:32.224
year, no student will have to
pay back more than 10% of their

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:35.858
discretionary income
toward their student debt.

00:03:35.858 --> 00:03:37.792
He also announced new
regulations regarding

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:40.858
prescription drugs to
prevent price gouging.

00:03:40.858 --> 00:03:42.491
And there's more to come.

00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.925
If the Republican
Congress won't join us,

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:47.792
we're going to continue to act
on our own to make the changes

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.625
that we can to bring relief to
middle-class families and those

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.925
aspiring to get in
the middle class.

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:57.892
Look, it's simple: We refuse
to take no for an answer.

00:03:57.892 --> 00:04:00.725
We know these steps taken alone
are not going to solve all of

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:03.391
our problems, but they will make
a difference in the lives of

00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:07.425
millions of American families
struggling to hold on.

00:04:07.425 --> 00:04:10.958
And you know and I know if the
Republicans would just let the

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.191
Congress do its job, let
it step up and meet its

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.525
responsibilities, we
could do so much more,

00:04:17.525 --> 00:04:19.291
and we could do it immediately.

00:04:19.291 --> 00:04:22.491
That's why the President and
I need your help to tell your

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:25.792
Republican congressmen
and senators to step up.

00:04:25.792 --> 00:04:28.558
Tell them to stop worrying about
their jobs and start worrying

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:31.825
about yours because we're
all in this together,

00:04:31.825 --> 00:04:35.291
and together is the way we're
going to bring America back even

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.792
stronger than it was before.

00:04:37.792 --> 00:04:38.692
Thank you.
