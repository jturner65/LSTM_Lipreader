00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:06.767
Vice President Biden:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:10.633
I hope you're having a safe and
enjoyable Memorial Day Weekend.

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.400
I've got some good
news for us today.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.166
Not only is our economy
overall growing,

00:00:16.166 --> 00:00:18.767
but one of the important sectors
of our economy is on the rise

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:22.300
again: the American
automobile industry.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.700
Just a few days ago, on Tuesday,
Chrysler Corporation announced

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.500
that they were repaying the
taxpayers for the loans we gave

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.700
them when we came into office.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.467
And this announcement came six
years ahead of schedule --

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.967
and just two years after
Chrysler Corporation emerged

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:39.400
from bankruptcy.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.367
You know, and it's a sign of
what's happening throughout the

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:43.367
American automobile industry.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:45.166
It's not just Chrysler.

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.367
Also this week, GM announced
that its Detroit Hamtramck

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:52.233
factory will run three
shifts for the first time its

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.500
26-year history.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.133
You know, that's 2,500
more good, paying jobs.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:03.667
In the words of Don
LaForest, of the UAW --

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.200
and I want to quote
him -- he said,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.233
"It's mind-boggling that we can
go from near-extinction to full

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.200
employment in two years."

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.867
What you didn't get to hear in
my rendition of his quote is the

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.934
tone of his voice:
It was full of pride.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.867
Genuine pride.

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:25.767
Because I can tell you he knows
-- as my dad used to say --

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:28.567
that a job is about a
lot more than a paycheck.

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:29.667
It's about dignity.

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.333
It's about respect.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.533
And I heard the same pride, and
the same feeling of dignity,

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.333
when I called the Jefferson
North Chrysler plant in Detroit

00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:41.066
the day Chrysler
paid back its debt.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.333
I talked to a UAW worker
-- her name was Frances --

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.500
a line worker, who said her dad
had worked on that line before,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.367
and that she had been out of
work for two-and-a-half years

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:55.066
before she was hired a
year ago back to the plant.

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:58.033
I got the same sense when I
went to Bonneville and Son,

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.900
a Chrysler dealership
in Manchester,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.834
New Hampshire a couple days ago.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:05.667
85 employees came out, stood
out there in the lot with me.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.100
85 people.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.400
All of whom knew and said,
had Chrysler liquidated,

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.000
had we not helped them,
they wouldn't have a job.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.867
When President Obama
and I came into office,

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:19.033
we faced an auto industry
on the brink of extinction.

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.300
Total collapse.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.500
At the time, many people thought
the President should just let GM

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.333
and Chrysler go under.

00:02:25.333 --> 00:02:28.433
They didn't think the automobile
industry was essential to

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:30.333
America's future.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.100
The President disagreed
-- and, in addition,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.533
he wasn't willing to walk
away from the thousands of

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:39.567
hardworking UAW members who
worked at GM and Chrysler --

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.233
and in many cases, not
only all their lives,

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:45.000
but as second and third
generation employees.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.200
And he certainly wasn't going
to abandon an industry that had

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.667
meant so much to our economy,
and so much to so many

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.400
for so long.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.834
So, he said if GM and Chrysler,
and their management,

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:59.834
and all their shareholders were
willing to do the difficult work

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:02.367
of making themselves
more competitive,

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.433
we would support giving
them another chance.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:09.166
And because of what we did,
the automobile industry is

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:10.767
rising again.

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:12.934
Manufacturing is coming back.

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:17.300
And our economy is recovering
and it's gaining traction.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.033
But the thing is this: even
for a lot of people with jobs,

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:24.700
their wages aren't keeping pace
with prices of everything from

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.567
gas to groceries to health
care and college tuition.

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.200
That's why the President
and I remain focused on,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.967
not just recovering
from this recession.

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:37.934
We're focused on making
sure that if you work hard,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.867
play by the rules, you'll
be able to get ahead,

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:43.800
put your kids through
college, retire with dignity

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.367
and security.

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.600
Before I sign off, I just want
to mention once again Memorial

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.266
Day and remember what
this holiday's all about.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:55.433
You know -- we still have tens
of thousands of troops deployed

00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:57.667
in harm's way.

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:00.700
In days past, on Memorial Day,
we remembered heroes from former

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.367
wars -- but I think it's
absolutely essential that we all

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:09.100
remember today that thousands of
names have been added to those

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.200
memorials in the wars
that are still continuing.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.767
Folks, all I ask you to do is,
what my wife Jill and Michelle

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:22.066
Obama have been asking, to reach
out to those families who have

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:25.767
someone deployed,
in your community.

00:04:25.767 --> 00:04:27.867
Let them know you know.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:31.300
Let them know you know the
sacrifice they're making.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.000
Engage in -- as my wife would
say -- a single act of kindness.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.667
Maybe invite them to your
barbecue this weekend.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:38.433
Mow their lawn.

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:41.066
Offer to mow their
lawn next week.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:44.400
Make it known that you
appreciate their sacrifice and

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.533
you're willing to lend a hand.

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:50.400
As I said, that's what Jill and
Michelle Obama are doing through

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.133
their Joining Forces initiative.

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:55.467
And that's what I hope all of us
will do every day as long as we

00:04:55.467 --> 00:04:58.734
have a man or woman
deployed in harm's way.

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:01.200
Thank you for listening
and enjoy the holiday.
