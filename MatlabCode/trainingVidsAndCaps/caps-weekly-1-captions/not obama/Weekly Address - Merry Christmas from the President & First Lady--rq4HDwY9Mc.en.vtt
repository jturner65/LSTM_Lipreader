00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:07.467
The President:
Merry Christmas, everybody.

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:09.333
Michelle and I just wanted to
take a moment today to send

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:11.867
greetings from our
family to yours.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:13.900
The First Lady:
This is one of our
favorite times of year.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.667
And we're so fortunate to be
able to celebrate it together in

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.300
this wonderful home.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.934
This is the "People's House."

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.700
So Barack and I try to open it
to as many people as we can,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.233
especially during
the holiday season.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:29.700
You know, his month, more than
100,000 Americans have passed

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.533
through these halls.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:35.166
And the idea behind this
year's theme, "Simple Gifts,"

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:38.500
is that the greatest blessings
of all are the ones that don't

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.066
cost a thing -- the comfort of
spending time with loved ones,

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.533
the freedoms we
enjoy as Americans,

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.767
and the joy we feel upon
giving something of ourselves.

00:00:49.767 --> 00:00:53.333
So in this time of family,
and friends, and good cheer,

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:56.500
let's also be sure to look
out for those who are less

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.200
fortunate, who've hit
a run of bad luck,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.934
or who are hungry and
alone this holiday season.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:06.533
The President:
Because this is the season when
we celebrate the simplest yet

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.433
most profound gift of all: the
birth of a child who devoted his

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:14.767
life to a message of peace,
love, and redemption.

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.467
A message that says
no matter who we are,

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.867
we are called to
love one another --

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:23.533
we are our brother's keeper,
we are our sister's keeper;

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:28.700
our separate stories in this big
and busy world are really one.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.934
Today, we're also thinking of
those who can't be home for the

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:36.533
holidays -- especially all our
courageous countrymen serving overseas.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.033
That's the message I delivered
when I visited our troops in

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.233
Afghanistan a few weeks ago --
that while you may be serving

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:47.033
far from home, every American
supports you and your families.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:48.433
We are with you.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:53.033
And I have no greater honor than
serving as your Commander-in-Chief.

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:55.700
Today's soldiers,
sailors, airmen, Marines,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
and Coast Guardsmen make up the
finest fighting force in the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.300
history of the world.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.333
Just like their predecessors,
they do extraordinary things in

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.934
service to their country.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.934
What makes that all the more
remarkable is that today's

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.533
military is an
all-volunteer force --

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:14.700
a force of mothers and
fathers, sons and daughters,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.500
husbands and wives.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.433
The First Lady:
That's right.

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:20.633
And as First Lady, I've had the
honor to meet members of our

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:24.500
military and their families on
bases and in communities all

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.166
across the country.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:29.900
I've gotten to know husbands and
wives doing the parenting of two

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.400
while their spouse is
on another deployment;

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.667
children trying their best in
school but always wondering when

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:39.533
mom or dad is coming home;
patriots putting their lives on

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:43.033
hold to help with a
loved one's recovery;

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:46.133
or carry on the memory
of a fallen hero.

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.066
When our men and women in
uniform answer the call to

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:52.400
serve, their
families serve, too.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.233
And they're proud
and glad to do it.

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:59.266
But as long as that service
keeps the rest of us safe,

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:02.667
their sacrifice should
also be our own.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.200
Even heroes can use a hand,
especially during the holidays.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.467
The President:
So we're encouraging Americans
to ask what you can do to

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:14.567
support our troops and their
families in this holiday season.

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:18.834
For some ideas on how to get
started, just visit serve.gov.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:22.133
The First Lady:
You'll see that you don't need
to be an expert in military life

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:25.367
to give back to those
who give so much to us.

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:28.033
There are countless ways to
contribute by harnessing your

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.767
unique talents.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.734
If you live near a base, you can
reach out through your local

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:34.400
school or your church.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.567
If you don't, you can volunteer
with organizations that support

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.300
military families.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.066
And anybody can send a care
package or pre-paid calling card

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.700
to the front lines, or give
what's sometimes the most

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.233
important gift of all:
simply saying "thank you."

00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:54.800
The President:
America's brave servicemen and
women represent a small fraction

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.600
of our population.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.967
But they -- and the families
who await their safe return --

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:03.600
carry far more than their
fair share of the burden.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.066
They've done everything
they've been asked to do.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:08.767
They've been everything
we've asked them to be.

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:11.500
And even as we speak, many are
fighting halfway around the

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.834
globe -- in hopes that someday,
our children and grandchildren

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:17.633
won't have to.

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.033
So let's all remind them this
holiday season that we're

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:23.333
thinking of them -- and that
America will forever be here for

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:26.200
them, just as they've
been there for us.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.767
And on behalf of
Michelle, Malia, Sasha --

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:31.033
The First Lady:
And Bo.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.767
The President:
And Bo -- have a
very Merry Christmas.

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:35.867
The First Lady:
And an even happier New Year.
