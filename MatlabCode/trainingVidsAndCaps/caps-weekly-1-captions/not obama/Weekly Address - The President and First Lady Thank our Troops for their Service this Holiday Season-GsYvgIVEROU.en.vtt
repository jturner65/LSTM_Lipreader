The President:
Hi everyone.

00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:09.967
As you gather with family and
friends this weekend, Michelle,

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:14.066
Malia, Sasha and I - and of
course Bo - want to wish you all

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.033
Merry Christmas
and Happy Holidays.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.233
The First Lady:
This is such a
wonderful time of year.

00:00:18.233 --> 00:00:21.900
It's a time to honor the story
of love and redemption that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.633
began 2,000 years ago... a
time to see the world through

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:30.000
a child's eyes and rediscover
the magic all around us...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.533
and a time to give thanks
for the gifts that bless us

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.233
every single day.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.633
This holiday season
at the White House,

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.934
we wanted to show our thanks
with a very special holiday

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.233
tribute to some of the
strongest, bravest,

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.133
and most resilient members of
our American family - the men

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.033
and women who wear our country's
uniform and the families who

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:53.700
support them.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.333
The President:
For many military families,
the best gift this year is

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:00.734
a simple one - welcoming a
loved one back for the holidays.

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:04.233
You see, after nearly nine
years, our war in Iraq is over.

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.333
Our troops are coming home.

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.767
And across America, military
families are being reunited.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.667
So let's take a moment to give
thanks for their service;

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.233
for their families' service;
for our veterans' service.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:19.033
And let's say a prayer for all
our troops standing post all

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:22.633
over the world, especially
our brave men and women in

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:25.200
Afghanistan who are
serving, even as we speak,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.834
in harm's way to protect
the freedoms and security

00:01:27.834 --> 00:01:29.600
we hold dear.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.900
The First Lady:
Our veterans, troops, and
military families sacrifice

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.533
so much for us.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.500
So this holiday season, let's
make sure that all of them know

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.200
just how much we appreciate
everything they do.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.467
Let's ask ourselves,
"How can I give back?

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:50.600
How can my family serve them as
well as they've served us" One

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.934
way you can get started is to
visit JoiningForces.gov to find

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.967
out how you can get
involved in your community.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:02.734
The President:
Giving of ourselves; service to
others - that's what this season

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.100
is all about.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.333
For my family and
millions of Americans,

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.633
that's what Christmas
is all about.

00:02:08.633 --> 00:02:11.934
It reminds us that part of what
it means to love God is to love

00:02:11.934 --> 00:02:16.233
one another, to be our brother's
keeper and our sister's keeper.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.867
But that belief is not just at
the center of our Christian

00:02:18.867 --> 00:02:22.433
faith, it's shared by Americans
of all faiths and backgrounds.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:23.934
It's why so many
of us, every year,

00:02:23.934 --> 00:02:26.667
volunteer our time to
help those most in need;

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.166
especially our hungry
and our homeless.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:31.600
So whatever you believe,
wherever you're from,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.734
let's remember the spirit of
service that connects us all to

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.066
this season - as Americans.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.667
Each of us can do our part to
serve our communities and our

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:43.333
country, not just
today, but every day.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:47.100
The First Lady:
So from our family to
yours, Merry Christmas.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.300
The President:
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays,
Happy New Year, everybody.
