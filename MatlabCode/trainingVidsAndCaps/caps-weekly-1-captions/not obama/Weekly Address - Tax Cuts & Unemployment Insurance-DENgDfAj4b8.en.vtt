00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.567
Vice President Biden:
Hi, this is Joe Biden.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.767
I'm filling in for President
Obama this weekend because he's

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.900
on his way back
from Afghanistan,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.633
where he was spending some time
with the brave men and women of

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.667
our Armed Forces.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.333
You all know it's tough -- it's tough to be far away from home

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.300
during the holidays if you're --
especially in a warzone,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.800
so he wanted to be there in person to thank all of those

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.433
troops on behalf of the American people for the service and

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:33.133
sacrifice each one
of them are making.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.200
And here at home, the First
Lady and my wife Jill have made

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.567
supporting military
families a priority.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.667
You know, these families are also making difficult sacrifices

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.867
for our country, and they deserve our admiration and our

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:48.100
gratitude as well.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.200
Our service members and their families are always on our

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.667
minds, even as the President and I are working on other issues

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.900
that are in -- critically important to the American people

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.500
-- issues that the American people are deeply concerned

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.800
about: accelerating the
recovery, growing our economy,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.600
strengthening our middle class,
and getting our friends and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.667
neighbors back to work.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.700
In recent months, we've seen
encouraging signs on that front.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.033
After shrinking for
four straight quarters,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:18.900
our economy has now grown
five straight quarters.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.166
After nearly two
years of job loss,

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.867
our economy has created more
than one million private sector

00:01:24.867 --> 00:01:26.967
jobs just this year.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.066
And after teetering on the
brink of liquidation last year,

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.867
our auto industry is
posting healthy gains,

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.767
assembly lines
are running again,

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.633
and American manufacturing
is getting up off the mat and

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:41.000
fighting its way back.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.066
Still, Friday's jobs report was
a sobering reminder of that.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:49.300
While we saw another month
of job growth in November,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.133
it just wasn't enough.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:54.900
And it underscores why it's so
important to get going without

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.166
delay on the two things that will most impact on growing our economy.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.900
The first is, we've got to extend the tax cuts for the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.166
middle class that are set to expire at the end of this month.

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.333
If we don't extend those tax cuts for the middle class,

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:13.567
millions of people, millions of families will see a big bite out

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:16.433
of their paychecks
starting on January 1.

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.633
And that's the last thing
we should let happen.

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:23.100
After a decade in which the middle class lost ground,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.667
families can
ill-afford a tax hike --

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:29.200
and our economy cannot afford the hit it will take if middle

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.400
class families have
less money to spend.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.767
And the second thing is -- we've got to do is we've got to extend

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:37.734
unemployment insurance for Americans who have lost their

00:02:37.734 --> 00:02:40.133
jobs in a tough economy.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:43.800
Without unemployment benefits,
families can't spend on basic

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.467
necessities that
are grown, made,

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.834
and sold by other Americans.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:52.066
Together, the economic hit
caused by raising taxes on the

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.233
middle class, and denying two
million Americans unemployment

00:02:55.233 --> 00:03:00.200
insurance, will wind up costing
us hundreds of thousands of jobs.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.200
And that just isn't smart.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.000
And cutting unemployment
insurance is not only not smart,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.734
it's not right either.

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.300
It would mean telling millions
of our neighbors who are out of

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.066
work today through no
fault of their own,

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.166
that they're on their own.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:17.033
That's no message to send
in the season of hope.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:20.600
We all know someone who's been hit hard; hit a rough patch.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.133
And when that
happens in America,

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.266
we help them get
back up on their feet.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:25.700
That's who we are.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.633
That's the American way.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.133
So I just don't agree with
the folks who've said we can't

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.500
afford a lifeline for Americans
who've lost their job during the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.667
worst recession in generations,
but we can afford to borrow

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:40.266
hundreds of billions of dollars
to extend tax cuts for the

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.767
wealthiest 2% of Americans.

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:47.133
That's bad economic policy, and
it's also just simply wrong.

00:03:47.133 --> 00:03:50.333
Congress must extend those
needed unemployment benefits

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:52.233
before it goes home this year.

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:55.767
And it must bolster economic
growth by preserving tax cuts

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.433
for our middle class.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:03:59.767
I'm glad that the House of
Representatives voted to do just

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:02.867
that this week, and I call
on the United States Senate to

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:04.734
do the same.

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:07.467
Look, folks, there's no doubt
these are tough times.

00:04:07.467 --> 00:04:10.533
But we are slowly but surely
fighting our way back,

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.800
moving forward.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.934
And we're going to keep
fighting to grow the economy,

00:04:13.934 --> 00:04:17.900
to strengthen the middle class, and to restore the American Dream.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.533
That's my pledge to you.

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:22.533
And hey, one last thing -- since the President will be back to

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:26.767
record this message next week, let me take this chance to say

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.934
from my family to yours: Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah,

00:04:30.934 --> 00:04:34.767
have a great Holiday season
and an even better New Year.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:36.000
Thanks.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.266
Enjoy the weekend.
