00:00:08.152 --> 00:00:10.653
President Obama:
Hello everyone,
and Merry Christmas.

00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:13.552
As you and your families gather
to celebrate the holidays, we

00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:16.619
wanted to take a moment to send
greetings from our family --

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.052
from me, from Michelle, from
Malia, Sasha -- and from Bo.

00:00:22.052 --> 00:00:24.085
First Lady:
This is our first
Christmas in the White House,

00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:27.952
and we are so grateful for
this extraordinary experience.

00:00:27.952 --> 00:00:29.985
Not far from here,
in the Blue Room,

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:32.552
is the official White
House Christmas Tree.

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:36.185
It's an 18-foot tall Douglas-fir
from West Virginia and it's

00:00:36.185 --> 00:00:39.653
decorated with hundreds of
ornaments designed by people and

00:00:39.653 --> 00:00:41.786
children from all
over the country.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.519
Each one is a reminder of
the traditions we cherish as

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.319
Americans and the blessings
we're thankful for this holiday season.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:51.653
President Obama:
That's right, especially
as we continue to recover

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:54.686
from an extraordinary recession
that still has so many Americans

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:57.486
hurting: parents without
a job who struggled to put

00:00:57.486 --> 00:01:00.419
presents under their Christmas
tree; families and neighbors

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:03.119
who've seen their home foreclosed; folks wondering

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:05.319
what the New Year will bring.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.386
But even in these tough times,
there's still so much to

00:01:08.386 --> 00:01:10.352
celebrate this Christmas.

00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:12.386
A message of peace
and brotherhood,

00:01:12.386 --> 00:01:16.985
that continues to inspire more
than 2,000 years after Jesus' birth.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:19.753
The love of family and friends.

00:01:19.753 --> 00:01:22.319
The bonds of
community and country.

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.419
And the character and courage of
our men and women in uniform who

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:27.686
are far from home
for the holidays,

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:32.085
away from their families,
risking their lives to protect ours.

00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:34.519
To all our soldiers,
sailors, airmen,

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:37.486
Marines and Coast Guardsmen --
I have no greater honor than

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:39.886
serving as your
Commander in Chief.

00:01:39.886 --> 00:01:42.152
I've been awed by
your selfless spirit,

00:01:42.152 --> 00:01:47.185
your eagerness to serve --
at the Naval Academy and West Point.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:49.753
I've been energized by your
dedication to duty -- from

00:01:49.753 --> 00:01:52.486
Baghdad to the Korean Peninsula.

00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:55.919
Michelle and I have been moved
by your determination -- wounded

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:59.319
warriors at Walter Reed and
Bethesda, fighting to recover,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.085
to get back to your units.

00:02:02.085 --> 00:02:04.486
And I've been
humbled, profoundly,

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:08.886
by patriots who have made the
ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

00:02:08.886 --> 00:02:11.919
In flag-draped caskets
coming home at Dover.

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:14.886
In the quiet solitude
of Arlington.

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:17.185
And after years of
multiple tours of duty,

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:19.886
as you carry on with our
missions in Iraq and

00:02:19.886 --> 00:02:23.686
Afghanistan, your service, your
readiness to make that same

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:29.819
sacrifice, is an inspiration
to us and to every single American.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.085
First Lady:
And so are your families.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:35.152
As First Lady, one of my
greatest privileges is to visit

00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:38.052
with military families
across the country.

00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:42.552
I've met military spouses doing
the parenting of two -- keeping

00:02:42.552 --> 00:02:46.152
the household together, juggling
play dates and soccer games,

00:02:46.152 --> 00:02:49.386
helping with homework, doing
everything they can to make the

00:02:49.386 --> 00:02:54.419
kids feel OK even as they try
to hide their own fears and worries.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.819
I've met kids who wonder when
mom or dad is coming home;

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.786
grandparents and relatives
who step in to care for

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.753
wounded warriors; and folks
trying to carry on after losing

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:09.019
the person they loved
most in the world.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.919
And through it all, these
families somehow still find the

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:17.819
time and energy to serve their
communities as well -- coaching

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.286
Little League, running the PTA,
raising money to help those less

00:03:22.286 --> 00:03:25.152
fortunate than
they are, and more.

00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:29.019
But even these strong military
families can use a hand,

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.286
especially during the holidays.

00:03:31.286 --> 00:03:33.686
If you live near
a military base,

00:03:33.686 --> 00:03:35.952
you can reach out through
your workplaces,

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:37.985
your schools, your churches.

00:03:37.985 --> 00:03:41.019
There are so many ways to
help -- with child care,

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.952
with errands, or just by just
bringing over a home-cooked meal.

00:03:44.952 --> 00:03:48.219
Even if you don't know a
military family nearby,

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.552
your family can still help by
donating or volunteering at

00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:55.185
organizations that support
military families.

00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:57.386
President Obama:
You can also reach out
directly to our forces

00:03:57.386 --> 00:03:58.619
around the world.

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:03.352
Kids can make a card that will
bring a smile to an American far from home.

00:04:03.352 --> 00:04:06.753
Adults can send a care package
or a pre-paid phone card that

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:09.452
makes the tour just
a little bit easier.

00:04:09.452 --> 00:04:12.552
Every American can do something
to support our troops,

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.719
even if it's as simple
as just saying thank you.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:18.185
For more ways to let
our troops know you care,

00:04:18.185 --> 00:04:22.252
go to www.whitehouse.gov.

00:04:22.252 --> 00:04:25.019
So to all our men and women in
uniform spending the holidays

00:04:25.019 --> 00:04:27.786
far away from home -- whether it's at a base here in the

00:04:27.786 --> 00:04:32.419
states, a mess hall in Iraq or a
remote outpost in Afghanistan,

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.653
know that you are in our
thoughts and our prayers.

00:04:35.653 --> 00:04:38.719
And this holiday season -- and
every holiday season -- know

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.919
that we are doing everything in our power to make sure you can

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.619
succeed in your missions and come home safe to your families.

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:50.019
First Lady:
And to all Americans,
from our family to yours,

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:51.419
Merry Christmas.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.919
President Obama:
Merry Christmas, everybody.
