00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.895
The President:
It's now been a little over
a month since I signed health

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:13.194
insurance reform into law.

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:16.227
And while it will take some time
to fully implement this law,

00:00:16.227 --> 00:00:20.494
reform is already delivering
real benefits to millions of Americans.

00:00:20.494 --> 00:00:23.394
Already, we're seeing a health
care system that holds insurance

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:27.461
companies more accountable and
gives consumers more control.

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:30.661
Two weeks ago, four million
small business owners and

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.528
organizations found a postcard
in their mailbox informing them

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:38.661
that they could be eligible for
a health care tax cut this year

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.127
-- a tax cut potentially worth tens of thousands of dollars;

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:45.194
a tax cut that will help
millions provide coverage to

00:00:45.194 --> 00:00:46.961
their employees.

00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:49.895
Starting in June, businesses
will get even more relief for

00:00:49.895 --> 00:00:54.161
providing coverage to retirees
who are not yet eligible for Medicare.

00:00:54.161 --> 00:00:57.161
And a little over a month
from now, on June 15th,

00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.895
senior citizens who fall into
the prescription drug coverage

00:00:59.895 --> 00:01:04.695
gap known as the "donut hole"
will start receiving a $250

00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.494
rebate to help them
afford their medication.

00:01:07.494 --> 00:01:09.828
Aside from providing real,
tangible benefits to the

00:01:09.828 --> 00:01:13.561
American people, the new health
care law has also begun to end

00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.361
the worst practices of
insurance companies.

00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:19.328
For too long, we've been held
hostage to an insurance industry

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:23.361
that jacks up premiums and
drops coverage as they please.

00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:25.795
But those days are
finally coming to an end.

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.661
After our administration
demanded that Anthem Blue Cross

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:32.761
justify a 39% premium
increase on Californians,

00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:36.194
the company admitted the error
and backed off its plan.

00:01:36.194 --> 00:01:38.795
And this week, our Secretary
of Health and Human Services,

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:42.094
Kathleen Sebelius, wrote a
letter to all states urging them

00:01:42.094 --> 00:01:45.728
to investigate other rate hikes
and stop insurance companies

00:01:45.728 --> 00:01:47.661
from gaming the system.

00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:49.127
To help states
achieve this goal,

00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:51.961
we've set up a new Office
of Consumer Information and

00:01:51.961 --> 00:01:55.194
Insurance Oversight, and will
provide grants to states with

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.294
the best oversight programs.

00:01:57.294 --> 00:02:00.027
In the next month, we'll also be
putting in place a new patients'

00:02:00.027 --> 00:02:01.361
bill of rights.

00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:03.828
It'll provide simple and clear
information to consumers about

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:05.961
their choices and their rights.

00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:08.961
It'll set up an appeals
process to enforce those rights.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.394
And it will prohibit insurance
companies from limiting a

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:14.561
patients' access to their
preferred primary care provider,

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:17.895
ob-gyn, or emergency room care.

00:02:17.895 --> 00:02:19.828
We're holding insurance
companies accountable in other

00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:21.194
ways, as well.

00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:24.161
As of September, the new health
care law prohibits insurance

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.328
companies from dropping people's
coverage when they get sick and

00:02:27.328 --> 00:02:28.828
need it most.

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:31.061
But when we found out that
an insurance company was

00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.594
systematically dropping the
coverage of women diagnosed with

00:02:33.594 --> 00:02:37.594
breast cancer, my administration
called on them to put an end to

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:39.861
this practice immediately.

00:02:39.861 --> 00:02:42.761
Two weeks ago, the entire
insurance industry announced

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:45.661
that it would comply with the
new law early and stop the

00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:49.528
perverse practice of dropping
people's coverage when they get sick.

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:51.661
On Monday, we'll also be
announcing the new rule that

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:53.895
allows young adults without
insurance to stay on their

00:02:53.895 --> 00:02:56.695
parents' plan until
they're 26 years old.

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:59.328
Even though insurance companies
have until September to comply

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:03.261
with this rule, we've asked them
to do so immediately to avoid

00:03:03.261 --> 00:03:07.361
coverage gaps for new college
graduates and other young adults.

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.961
This also makes good business
sense for insurance companies,

00:03:09.961 --> 00:03:12.394
and we're pleased
that most have agreed.

00:03:12.394 --> 00:03:14.294
Now we need employers
to do the same,

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:17.828
and we're willing to work with
them to make this transition possible.

00:03:17.828 --> 00:03:20.094
These changes mean that
starting this spring,

00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:22.294
when young adults
graduate from college,

00:03:22.294 --> 00:03:25.628
many who do not have health care
coverage will be able to stay on

00:03:25.628 --> 00:03:28.294
their parents' insurance
for a few more years.

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:31.494
And you can check
healthreform.gov to find a list

00:03:31.494 --> 00:03:34.094
of all the insurance carriers
who have agreed to participate

00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:35.961
right away.

00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:37.928
I've said before that
implementing health insurance

00:03:37.928 --> 00:03:41.194
reform won't happen overnight,
and it will require some tweaks

00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:43.161
and changes along the way.

00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.928
Ultimately, we'll have a system
that provides more control for

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:49.061
consumers, more accountability
for insurance companies,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.328
and more affordable choices
for uninsured Americans.

00:03:52.328 --> 00:03:55.194
But already, we're seeing how
reform is improving the lives of

00:03:55.194 --> 00:03:56.961
millions of Americans.

00:03:56.961 --> 00:04:00.194
Already, we are watching small
businesses learn that they will

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.594
soon pay less for health care.

00:04:02.594 --> 00:04:04.828
We are seeing retirees realize
they'll be able to keep their

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:08.795
coverage; seniors realize they'll be able to afford their prescriptions.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:12.027
We're seeing consumers get a
break from unfair rate hikes and

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:14.695
patients get the care they
need when they need it,

00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:17.361
and young adults getting the
security of knowing that they

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:20.761
can start off life with one
less cost to worry about.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.628
At long last, this is what
health care reform is achieving.

00:04:24.628 --> 00:04:26.361
This is what change looks like.

00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:29.494
And this is the promise we will
keep as we continue to make this

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:32.161
law a reality in the
months and years to come.

00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:33.261
Thanks so much.
