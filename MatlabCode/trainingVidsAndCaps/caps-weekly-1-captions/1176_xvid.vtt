00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:06.667
The President:
Hi.

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.066
I'm recording this message
from Seoul, South Korea,

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.000
as I finish up my first
presidential trip to Asia.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.834
As we emerge from the worst
recession in generations,

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.767
there is nothing more important
than to do everything we can to

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:21.133
get our economy moving again
and put Americans back to work,

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:24.000
and I will go anywhere
to pursue that goal.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.367
That's one of the main
reasons I took this trip.

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:30.100
Asia is a region where we now buy more goods and do more trade

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.200
than any other place
in the world --

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.266
commerce that supports
millions of jobs back home.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.166
It's also a place where the risk
of a nuclear arms race threatens

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:41.000
our security, and where
extremists plan attacks on

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.700
American soil.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.000
And since this region includes
some of the fastest-growing

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.967
nations, there can be no
solution to the challenge of

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:52.200
climate change without the
cooperation of the Asia Pacific.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.300
With this in mind, I traveled
to Asia to open up a new era of

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.867
American engagement.

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:59.600
We made progress with China
and Russia in sending a unified

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.900
message to Iran and North Korea
that they must live up to their

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.767
international obligations and
either forsake nuclear weapons

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:08.734
or face the consequences.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.467
As the two largest consumers
and producers of energy,

00:01:11.467 --> 00:01:15.033
we developed a host of new clean
energy initiatives with China,

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.734
and our two nations agreed to
work toward a successful outcome

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.133
at the upcoming climate
summit in Copenhagen --

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.400
an outcome that leads to
immediate action to reduce

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.066
carbon pollution.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:28.667
And I spoke to young men and
women at a town hall in Shanghai

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:31.533
and across the Internet about
certain values that we in

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.400
America believe are universal:
the freedom of worship and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.500
speech; the right to access
information and to choose one's

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.200
own leaders.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.934
But above all, I spoke with
leaders in every nation I

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:46.800
visited about what we can do to
sustain this economic recovery

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.100
and bring back jobs and
prosperity for our people --

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.467
a task I will continue to focus
on relentlessly in the weeks and

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.166
months ahead.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:57.900
This recession has taught us that we can't return to a

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.266
situation where America's
economic growth is fueled by

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.800
consumers who take out
more and more debt.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.266
In order to keep growing, we
need to spend less, save more,

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:09.867
and get our federal
deficit under control.

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:13.033
We also need to place a greater
emphasis on exports that we can

00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:15.533
build, produce, and
sell to other nations --

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:19.100
exports that can help create new
jobs at home and raise living

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.200
standards throughout the world.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.467
For example, if we can increase
our exports to Asia Pacific

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:28.133
nations by just 5%, we can
increase the number of American

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:32.033
jobs supported by these exports
by hundreds of thousands.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.367
This is already happening
with businesses like American

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.767
Superconductor Corporation, an
energy technology startup based

00:02:37.767 --> 00:02:40.934
in Massachusetts that's been
providing wind power and smart

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.867
grid systems to countries
like China, Korea, and India.

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:49.166
By doing so, it's added more
than 100 jobs over the last few years.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:53.533
Increasing our exports is one
way to create new jobs and new prosperity.

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:55.900
But as we emerge from a
recession that has left millions

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.800
without work, we have an
obligation to consider every

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.400
additional, responsible step
we can take to encourage and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.066
accelerate job creation
in this country.

00:03:05.066 --> 00:03:07.133
That's why I've announced
that in the next few weeks,

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:10.533
we'll be holding a forum at the
White House on jobs and economic growth.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.066
I want to hear from CEOs
and small business owners,

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:15.500
economists and
financial experts,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.400
as well as representatives
from labor unions and nonprofit

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.967
groups, about what they think
we can do to spur hiring and get

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:24.266
this economy moving again.

00:03:24.266 --> 00:03:26.300
It's important that we don't make any ill-considered

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.934
decisions -- even with
the best of intentions --

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:31.834
particularly at a time when
our resources are so limited.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:35.433
But it's just as important that
we are open to any demonstrably

00:03:35.433 --> 00:03:38.467
good idea to supplement the
steps we've already taken to put

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:40.266
America back to work.

00:03:40.266 --> 00:03:42.734
That's what I hope to
achieve in this forum.

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:45.333
Still, there's no forum or
policy that can bring all the

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.700
jobs we've lost overnight.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.333
I wish there were, because
so many Americans --

00:03:50.333 --> 00:03:53.066
friends, neighbors,
family members --

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.233
are desperately
looking for work.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:56.734
But even though
it will take time,

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:59.734
I can promise you this: we are
moving in the right direction;

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:02.066
that the steps we are
taking are helping;

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:05.533
and I will not let up until
businesses start hiring again,

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.834
unemployed Americans
start working again,

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:10.900
and we rebuild this economy
stronger and more prosperous

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.734
than it was before.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:15.800
That has been the focus of our
efforts these past ten months --

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.500
and it will continue to be our
focus in the months and years to come.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.533
Thanks.
