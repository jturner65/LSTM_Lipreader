00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:11.461
The President:
I'd like to speak with you for
a few minutes today about the

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.428
tragedy that took
place at Ft. Hood.

00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:17.795
This past Thursday, on
a clear Texas afternoon,

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:21.094
an Army psychiatrist walked into
the Soldier Readiness Processing

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:25.061
Center, and began shooting
his fellow soldiers.

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:27.261
It's an act of violence that would have been heartbreaking

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:29.528
had it occurred
anyplace in America.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:31.895
It's a crime that would have
horrified us had its victims

00:00:31.895 --> 00:00:34.461
been Americans of
any background.

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:36.494
But it's all the more
heartbreaking and all the more

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:39.761
despicable because of the
place where it occurred and the

00:00:39.761 --> 00:00:42.661
patriots who were its victims.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.961
The SRP is where our men and
women in uniform go before

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.561
getting deployed.

00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.528
It's where they get their
teeth checked and their medical

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:52.994
records updated and make sure
everything is in order before

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:54.828
getting shipped out.

00:00:54.828 --> 00:00:58.294
It was in this place, on a base
where our soldiers ought to feel

00:00:58.294 --> 00:01:01.795
most safe, where those brave
Americans who are preparing to

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.594
risk their lives in
defense of our nation,

00:01:04.594 --> 00:01:08.161
lost their lives in a
crime against our nation.

00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:10.695
Soldiers stationed
in Iraq, Afghanistan,

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.594
and around the world called
and emailed loved ones at Ft.

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:18.227
Hood, all expressing the same
stunned reaction: I'm supposed

00:01:18.227 --> 00:01:22.428
to be the one in
harm's way, not you.

00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:24.394
Thursday's shooting was one
of the most devastating ever

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:27.094
committed on an
American military base.

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:30.127
And yet, even as we saw the
worst of human nature on full

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:33.361
display, we also saw
the best of America.

00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.394
We saw soldiers and civilians
alike rushing to the aid fallen

00:01:36.394 --> 00:01:39.161
comrades; tearing off
bullet-riddled clothes to treat

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:42.361
the injured; using
blouses as tourniquets;

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:46.561
taking down the shooter even
as they bore wounds themselves.

00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:50.161
We saw soldiers bringing to bear
on our own soil the skills they

00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:54.194
had been trained to use abroad;
skills that been honed through

00:01:54.194 --> 00:01:57.494
years of determined effort for
one purpose and one purpose

00:01:57.494 --> 00:02:02.261
only: to protect and defend
the United States of America.

00:02:02.261 --> 00:02:06.661
We saw the valor, selflessness,
and unity of purpose that makes

00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:10.661
our servicemen and women the
finest fighting force on Earth;

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:13.161
that make the United States
military the best the world has

00:02:13.161 --> 00:02:17.328
ever known; and that make all
of us proud to be Americans.

00:02:17.328 --> 00:02:19.861
On Friday, I met with
FBI Director Mueller,

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.328
Defense Secretary Gates, and
representatives of the relevant

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:25.761
agencies to discuss their
ongoing investigation into what

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:27.928
led to this terrible crime.

00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:30.361
And I'll continue to be in
close contact with them as new

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.494
information comes in.

00:02:32.494 --> 00:02:35.895
We can't fully know what leads
a man to do such a thing.

00:02:35.895 --> 00:02:38.961
But what we do know is that our
thoughts are with every single

00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:42.561
one of the men and women who were injured at Ft. Hood.

00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.428
Our thoughts are with all the
families who've lost a loved one

00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:47.261
in this national tragedy.

00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:50.061
And our thoughts are with
all the Americans who wear --

00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:53.127
or have worn -- the proud uniform of the United States of

00:02:53.127 --> 00:02:57.227
America; our soldiers,
sailors, airmen, Marines,

00:02:57.227 --> 00:03:00.027
and coast guardsmen, and the military families who love and

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.528
support them.

00:03:01.528 --> 00:03:03.628
In tribute to those
who fell at Ft. Hood,

00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:05.695
I've ordered flags flying
over the White House,

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:09.194
and other federal buildings to
be lowered to half-staff from

00:03:09.194 --> 00:03:12.294
now until Veterans
Day next Wednesday.

00:03:12.294 --> 00:03:14.628
Veterans Day is our chance to
honor those Americans who've

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:18.494
served on battlefields
from Lexington to Antietam,

00:03:18.494 --> 00:03:24.628
Normandy to Manila, Inchon to
Khe Sanh, Ramadi to Kandahar.

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:27.961
They are Americans of every
race, faith, and station.

00:03:27.961 --> 00:03:32.561
They're Christians and
Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers.

00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:36.194
They are descendents of
immigrants and immigrants themselves.

00:03:36.194 --> 00:03:39.628
They reflect the diversity
that makes this America.

00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:43.227
But what they share is a
patriotism like no other.

00:03:43.227 --> 00:03:46.494
What they share is a commitment
to country that has been tested

00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.194
and proved worthy.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.861
What they share is the
same unflinching courage,

00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:54.594
unblinking compassion, and uncommon camaraderie that

00:03:54.594 --> 00:03:59.795
soldiers and civilians of Ft. Hood showed America and showed the world.

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:03.027
These are the men and
women we honor today.

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:06.294
These are the men and women
we honor on Veterans Day.

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:09.361
And these are the men and
women we shall honor every day,

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:11.895
in times of war
and times of peace,

00:04:11.895 --> 00:04:14.895
so long as our nation endures.
