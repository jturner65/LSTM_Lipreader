00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.367
The President:
It was little more than one year ago that our country faced a

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.900
potentially devastating
crisis in our auto industry.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.600
Over the course of 2008, the
industry shed 400,000 jobs.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.633
In the midst of a financial
crisis and deep recession,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:21.600
both General Motors
and Chrysler --

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.567
two companies that for
generations were a symbol of

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.633
America's manufacturing might -- were on the brink of collapse.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.734
The rapid dissolution
of these companies --

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:32.934
followed by the certain failure
of many auto parts makers,

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.600
and car dealers, and
other small businesses --

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.600
would have dealt a crippling
blow to our already suffering economy.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.433
The best estimates are that
more than one million American

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.967
workers could have
lost their jobs.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.633
The previous administration
extended temporary loans to both companies.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:52.767
Even so, when I took office,
the situation remained dire.

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:55.166
We had to determine whether or
not we could justify additional

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.934
taxpayer assistance.

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.967
After all, many of the problems
in the auto industry were a

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:02.867
direct result of poor management
decisions over decades.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:04.667
So it wasn't an easy call.

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.200
But we decided that while
providing additional assistance

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.800
was a risk, the far greater risk
to families and communities

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.467
across our country
was to do nothing.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:17.066
We agreed to additional help,
but only if the companies and

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.400
their stakeholders were willing
to break with the past.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.367
They had to fundamentally
reorganize,

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.100
with new management that would
reexamine the decisions that led

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.900
to this mess and chart
a path toward viability.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.834
I knew this wasn't
a popular decision.

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.734
But it was the right one.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:36.233
So, GM and Chrysler went through
painful restructurings: ones

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:40.433
that required enormous
sacrifices on the part of all involved.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:42.767
Many believed this
was a fool's errand.

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:45.500
Many feared we would be throwing
good money after bad: that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.233
taxpayers would lose most of
their investment and that these

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:51.300
companies would soon
fail regardless.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.333
But one year later, the
outlook is very different.

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:58.800
In fact, the industry is
recovering at a pace few thought possible.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.400
Just this week we received
some encouraging news.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.633
Since General Motors
emerged from bankruptcy,

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:07.567
the auto industry has
actually added 45,000 jobs --

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:09.734
the strongest
growth in a decade.

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.300
And Chrysler announced an
operating profit in the first

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.100
three months of this year.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.600
This is the first time Chrysler
has reported a profit since the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.033
beginning of the
economic crisis.

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.567
What's more, GM announced that
it paid back its loans to

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:26.834
taxpayers with interest, fully
five years ahead of schedule.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.800
It won't be too long before the
stock the Treasury is holding in

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.700
GM can be sold, helping to
reimburse the American people

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.633
for their investment.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.600
In addition, Chrysler Financial
has already fully repaid with

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.533
interest the loans it received
to support auto financing.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:44.066
And we're closing the books
on the temporary program that

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.734
helped parts suppliers
weather this storm --

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:51.734
returning this investment to the
Treasury in full, with interest, as well.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:54.266
Finally, we're bringing to
an end many of the emergency

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:57.400
programs designed to stabilize
the financial sector and restart

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.333
lending so folks could
finance cars and trucks --

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.900
as well as homes and
small businesses.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.400
On Friday, in fact, the Treasury
Department informed Congress

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.800
that this financial rescue -- which was absolutely necessary

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.900
to prevent an even worse economic disaster --

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.900
will end up costing taxpayers a
fraction of what was originally feared.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.266
This is a direct result of
the careful management of the

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.667
investments made by the American
people so that we could recoup

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:26.767
as many tax dollars as possible -- and as quickly as possible.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.100
These steps, as well
as others we've taken,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.867
have meant that millions of
people are working today who

00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:34.333
might otherwise have
lost their jobs.

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:36.834
But these steps were never
meant to be permanent.

00:03:36.834 --> 00:03:39.367
As I've said many times, I did
not run for president to get

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:42.600
into the auto business
or the banking business.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.066
As essential as it
was that we got in,

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.667
I'm glad to see that
we're getting out.

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:50.600
At the same time, even as
we've come a long way,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.533
we still have a ways to go.

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:54.567
The auto industry is
more stable today.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.834
And the economy is
on a better footing.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.533
But people are still hurting.

00:03:58.533 --> 00:04:01.400
I hear from them just about
every day in letters I read and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.400
in the towns and
cities that I visit.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.834
No matter what the
economic statistics say,

00:04:06.834 --> 00:04:11.600
I won't be satisfied until folks
who need work can find good jobs.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.367
After a recession that
stole 8 million jobs,

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:16.100
this is gonna take some time.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.333
And this will require that
we continue to tackle the

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:22.533
underlying problems that caused
this turmoil in the first place.

00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:25.967
In short, it's essential that we
learn the lessons of this crisis

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:28.066
-- or we risk repeating it.

00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:31.033
Now, part of what led to the
crisis in our auto industry --

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:33.834
and one of the main causes
of the economic downturn --

00:04:33.834 --> 00:04:36.333
were problems in our
financial sector.

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.600
In the absence of
common-sense rules,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.266
Wall Street firms took enormous,
irresponsible risks that

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.300
imperiled our
financial system --

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.400
and hurt just about every
sector of our economy.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.300
Some people simply forgot that
behind every dollar traded or

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.266
leveraged, there is a family
looking to buy a house,

00:04:53.266 --> 00:04:55.600
pay for an education,
open a business,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.533
or save for retirement.

00:04:57.533 --> 00:05:00.166
That's why I went to New York
City this week and addressed an

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:03.367
audience that included leaders
in the financial industry.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.767
And once again I called for
reforms to hold Wall Street

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.500
accountable and to
protect consumers.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.166
These reforms would put an
end -- once and for all --

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.000
to taxpayer bailouts.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.834
They would bring greater
transparency to complex

00:05:14.834 --> 00:05:16.400
financial dealings.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.600
And they will empower ordinary
consumers and shareholders in

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.900
our financial system.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.633
Folks will get clearer and more
concise information when they

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:27.400
make financial decisions -- instead of having to worry about

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.166
deceptive fine print.

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:31.433
And shareholders and pension
holders will have a stronger

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:34.266
voice in the boardrooms of
companies in which they invest

00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:35.900
their savings.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.066
That's how we'll restore trust
and confidence in our markets.

00:05:39.066 --> 00:05:41.467
That's how we'll help to put an
end to the cycle of boom and

00:05:41.467 --> 00:05:43.133
bust that we've seen.

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.867
And that's how -- after two
very difficult years --

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.033
we will not only
revive the economy,

00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:51.600
but help to rebuild it
stronger than ever before.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.834
Thanks.
