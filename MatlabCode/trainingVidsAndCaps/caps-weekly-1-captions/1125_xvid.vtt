00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.967
The President:
Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.033
historic piece of legislation
that will open the door to a

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.033
clean energy economy and a
better future for America.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:18.433
For more than three decades, we've talked about our

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:20.467
dependence on foreign oil.

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:24.533
And for more than three decades,
we have seen that dependence grow.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.033
We've seen our reliance on fossil fuels jeopardize our

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:28.600
national security.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.333
We've seen it pollute the air we breathe and endanger our planet.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.233
And most of all, we've seen other countries realize a

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:39.033
critical truth: the nation that
leads in the creation of a clean

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:42.200
energy economy will be the
nation that leads the 21st

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.266
century global economy.

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:48.200
Now is the time for the United
States of America to realize this, too.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.333
Now's the time for us to lead.

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:53.400
The energy bill that passed the
House will finally create a set

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.967
of incentives that will spark a
clean energy transformation in

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:58.367
our economy.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.533
It will spur the development of
low carbon sources of energy --

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.266
everything from wind, solar,
and geothermal power to safer

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.867
nuclear energy and cleaner coal.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:11.200
It will spur new energy savings,
like the efficient windows and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.100
other materials that reduce
heating costs in the winter and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.333
cooling costs in the summer.

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.266
And most importantly, it will
make possible the creation of

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.367
millions of new jobs.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:24.166
Make no mistake:
this is a jobs bill.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.433
We're already seeing why this
is true in the clean energy

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:29.066
investments we're making
through the Recovery Act.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.433
In California, 3,000 people will
be employed to build a new solar

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:37.700
plant that in turn will
create 1,000 permanent jobs.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.400
In Michigan, investment in wind
turbines and wind technology is

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.667
expected to create
over 2,600 jobs.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:48.367
In Florida, three new solar
projects are expected to employ

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:50.567
1,400 people.

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:54.100
The list goes on and on, but the
point is this: this legislation

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.700
will finally make clean energy
the profitable kind of energy.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.533
That will lead to the creation
of new businesses and entire new industries.

00:02:01.533 --> 00:02:06.333
And that will lead to American
jobs that pay well and can't be outsourced.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.033
I've often talked about the need to build a new foundation for

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.767
economic growth so that we don't return to the endless cycle of

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:15.800
bubble and bust that
led us to this recession.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.967
Clean energy and the jobs it
creates will be absolutely

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.467
critical to this new foundation.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.333
This legislation has also been
carefully written to address the

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.033
concerns that many have
expressed in the past.

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.767
Instead of increasing
the deficit,

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:31.333
it's paid for by the polluters
who currently emit dangerous

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.900
carbon emissions.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.533
It provides assistance to
businesses and families as they

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:40.000
make the gradual transition
to clean energy technologies.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.900
It gives rural communities and
farmers the opportunity to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.300
participate in climate solutions
and generate new income.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.567
And above all, it will protect
consumers from the costs of this

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:53.900
transition, so that in a decade,
the price to the average

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.967
American will be just about
a postage stamp a day.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:01.200
Because this legislation is
so balanced and sensible,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400
it's already attracted a remarkable coalition of consumer

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.567
and environmental groups;
labor and business leaders;

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.934
Democrats and Republicans.

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:12.867
And I want to thank every Member
of Congress who put politics

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:15.567
aside to support
this bill on Friday.

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.500
Now my call to every Senator,
as well as to every American,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.900
is this: We cannot be
afraid of the future.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.700
And we must not be
prisoners of the past.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.367
Don't believe the misinformation
out there that suggests that

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.066
there's somehow a contradiction between investing in clean

00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:32.467
energy and economic growth.

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:34.133
It's just not true.

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:36.734
We've been talking
about energy for decades.

00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:38.967
But there's no longer a
disagreement over whether our

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:42.400
dependence on foreign oil is
endangering our security.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.567
It is.

00:03:43.567 --> 00:03:46.033
There's no longer a debate about whether carbon pollution is

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:48.166
placing our planet in jeopardy.

00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:49.600
It's happening.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.066
And there's no longer a question about whether the jobs and

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:55.900
industries of the 21st century will be centered around clean,

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.800
renewable energy.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.233
The question is, which country
will create these jobs and these industries?

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.867
I want that answer to be the
United States of America.

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:08.567
And I believe that the American
people and the men and women

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:11.667
they sent to Congress
share that view.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.367
So I want to congratulate the
House for passing this bill,

00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:17.600
and I want to urge the Senate to
take this opportunity to come

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.266
together and meet
our obligations --

00:04:20.266 --> 00:04:24.934
to our constituents, to our
children, to God's creation,

00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:26.633
and to future generations.

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:27.867
Thanks for listening.
