00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.767
The President:
On Monday, the Banking Committee of the United States Senate will

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:12.667
debate a proposal to address the
abuse and excess that led to the

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.633
worst financial
crisis in generations.

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.667
These reforms are essential.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:19.433
As I've urged over
the past year,

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.200
we need common-sense rules
that will our allow markets to

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.033
function fairly and freely while
reining in the worst practices

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:27.900
of the financial industry.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
That's the central
lesson of this crisis.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.100
And we fail to heed that
lesson at our peril.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.734
Of course, there were many
causes of the economic turmoil

00:00:36.734 --> 00:00:39.467
that ripped through our country
over the past two years.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:42.834
But it was a crisis that began
in our financial system.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.000
Large banks engaged in reckless
financial speculation without

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.967
regard for the consequences -- and without tough oversight.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:52.600
Financial firms invented and
sold complicated financial

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.000
products to escape scrutiny
and conceal enormous risk.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.867
And there were some who engaged
in the rampant exploitation of

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:04.967
consumers to turn a quick profit
no matter who was hurt in the process.

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:08.467
Now, I have long been a vigorous
defender of free markets.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.166
And I believe we need a strong
and vibrant financial sector so

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:15.200
that businesses can get
loans and families can afford

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.233
mortgages; entrepreneurs can find the capital to start a new

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:22.934
company, sell a new product,
or offer a new service.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:25.433
But what we have seen over the
past two years is that without

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.934
reasonable and clear rules
to check abuse and protect

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:31.100
families, markets
don't function freely.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.300
In fact, it was
just the opposite.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.333
In the absence of such rules,
our financial markets spun out

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.900
of control, credit
markets froze,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.166
and our economy nearly plummeted
into a second Great Depression.

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.934
That's why financial
reform is so necessary.

00:01:45.934 --> 00:01:48.900
After months of bipartisan
work, Senator Chris Dodd and his

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.400
committee have offered a
strong foundation for reform,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.934
in line with the proposal
I previously laid out,

00:01:54.934 --> 00:01:58.000
and in line with the reform
bill passed by the House.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.100
It would provide greater
scrutiny of large financial

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.233
firms to prevent any one company
from threatening the entire

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:06.367
financial system -- and it
would update the rules so that

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:09.734
complicated financial products like derivatives are no longer

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:12.700
bought and sold
without oversight.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.200
It would prevent banks from
engaging in risky dealings

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.500
through their own hedge
funds -- while finally giving

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.633
shareholders a say on
executive salaries and bonuses.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:25.400
And through new tools to break
up failing financial firms,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.400
it would help ensure that
taxpayers are never again forced

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.867
to bail out a big bank because
it's "too big to fail."

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:35.900
Finally, these reforms include
a new Consumer Financial

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.633
Protection Agency.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.100
It would prevent predatory loan practices and other abuses to

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.667
ensure that consumers get clear information about loans and

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.533
other financial products before they sign on the dotted line.

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:49.633
Because this financial crisis
wasn't just the result of

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.800
decisions made by
large financial firms;

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.900
it was also the result of many
decisions made by ordinary

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.567
Americans to open credit
cards and take on mortgages.

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:01.967
And while there were many who
took out loans they knew they

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:04.567
couldn't afford, there were also
millions of people who signed

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:08.133
contracts they didn't fully
understand offered by lenders

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:10.500
who didn't always
tell the truth.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.867
This is in part because the
job of protecting consumers is

00:03:12.867 --> 00:03:15.967
spread across seven
different federal agencies,

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:18.433
none of which has the interests
of ordinary Americans as its

00:03:18.433 --> 00:03:20.266
principal concern.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.367
This diffusion of responsibility
has made it easier for credit

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:26.900
card companies to lure customers
with attractive offers and then

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.500
punish them in the fine print;
or for payday lenders and others

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.433
who charge outrageous interest
rates to operate without much

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:37.166
oversight; and for mortgage
brokers to entice homebuyers

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:40.400
with low initial rates only
to trap them with ballooning

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.500
payments down the line.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.133
For these banking
reforms to be complete --

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.967
for these reforms to meet the
measure of the crisis we've just

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:51.600
been through -- we need a consumer agency to advocate for

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.600
ordinary Americans and help enforce the rules that protect them.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.100
That's why I won't accept any
attempts to undermine the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.233
independence of this agency.

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:03.033
And I won't accept efforts to
create loopholes for the most

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:06.800
egregious abusers of consumers,
from payday lenders to auto

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.900
finance companies to
credit card companies.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.166
Unsurprisingly, this proposal
has been a source of contention

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.533
with financial firms who like
things just the way they are.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:19.100
In fact, the Republican leader
in the House reportedly met with

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.834
a top executive of one of
America's largest banks and made

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:27.633
thwarting reform a key part of
his party's pitch for campaign contributions.

00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.467
And this week, the allies
of bank and consumer finance

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:34.000
companies launched a
multimillion dollar ad campaign

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to fight against the proposal.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.300
You might call this 'air
support' for the army of

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.767
lobbyists already arm twisting
members of the committee to

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:45.834
reject those reforms and
block this consumer agency.

00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:48.667
Perhaps that's why, after months
of working with Democrats,

00:04:48.667 --> 00:04:51.867
Republicans walked away
from this proposal.

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.900
I regret that and urge
them to reconsider.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.166
The fact is, it's now been well
over a year since the near

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:01.400
collapse of the entire
financial system --

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.400
a crisis that helped wipe out
more than 8 million jobs and

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.367
that continues to exact a
terrible toll throughout our economy.

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:11.166
Yet today the very same system
that allowed this turmoil

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.967
remains in place.

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.467
No one disputes that.

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:16.800
No one denies that
reform is needed.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.433
So the question we have to
answer is very simple: will we

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:24.767
learn from this crisis, or will
we condemn ourselves to repeat it?

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:26.467
That's what's at stake.

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:29.567
I urge those in the Senate who
support these reforms to remain

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:32.967
strong, to resist the pressure
from those who would preserve

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:37.166
the status quo, to stand up
for their constituents and our country.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.834
And I promise to use every tool
at my disposal to see these

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:44.667
reforms enacted: to ensure
that the bill I sign into law

00:05:44.667 --> 00:05:47.567
reflects not the special
interests of Wall Street,

00:05:47.567 --> 00:05:50.066
but the best interests
of the American people.

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.400
Thank you.
