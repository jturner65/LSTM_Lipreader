00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.867
The President:
Right now in Washington,
our Senate and House of

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:13.500
Representatives are both
debating proposals for health

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.200
insurance reform.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.467
Today, I want to speak with you
about the stakes of this debate,

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:21.700
for our people and for
the future of our nation.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.133
This is an issue that affects
the health and financial

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:28.033
well-being of every single
American and the stability of

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.100
our entire economy.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.934
It's about every family unable
to keep up with soaring out of

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:37.400
pocket costs and premiums rising
three times faster than wages.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.300
Every worker afraid of losing
health insurance if they lose

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.800
their job, or change jobs.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.667
Everyone who's worried that they
may not be able to get insurance

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:49.500
or change insurance if
someone in their family has a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.700
pre-existing condition.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.533
It's about a woman in Colorado
who told us that when she was

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.867
diagnosed with breast cancer,
her insurance company --

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:01.066
the one she'd paid
over $700 a month to --

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.533
refused to pay
for her treatment.

00:01:03.533 --> 00:01:07.233
She had to use up her retirement
funds to save her own life.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:10.066
It's about a man from Maryland
who sent us his story --

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.266
a middle class college graduate
whose health insurance expired

00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.533
when he changed jobs.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.567
During that time, he
needed emergency surgery,

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:22.100
and woke up $10,000 in debt -- a debt that has left him unable to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.133
save, buy a home, or
make a career change.

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:28.600
It's about every business
forced to shut their doors,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.133
or shed jobs, or
ship them overseas.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.000
It's about state governments
overwhelmed by Medicaid,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.233
federal budgets
consumed by Medicare,

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:40.200
and deficits piling
higher year after year.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200
This is the status quo.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.000
This is the system
we have today.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.066
This is what the debate in
Congress is all about: Whether

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:51.667
we'll keep talking and tinkering
and letting this problem fester

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.934
as more families and
businesses go under,

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:56.467
and more Americans
lose their coverage.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.166
Or whether we'll seize
this opportunity --

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.900
one we might not have
again for generations --

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.734
and finally pass health
insurance reform this year,

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:07.567
in 2009.

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:11.033
Now we know there are those who
will oppose reform no matter what.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.166
We know the same special
interests and their agents in

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.800
Congress will make the
same old arguments,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.200
and use the same scare tactics
that have stopped reform before

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.100
because they profit from this
relentless escalation in health care costs.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.500
And I know that once you've seen
enough ads and heard enough

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.133
people yelling on TV, you might
begin to wonder whether there's

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.533
a grain of truth to
what they're saying.

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:36.266
So let me take a moment to
answer a few of their arguments.

00:02:36.266 --> 00:02:38.900
First, the same folks who
controlled the White House and

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.000
Congress for the past eight
years as we ran up record

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.533
deficits will argue --
believe it or not --

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:49.367
that health reform will
lead to record deficits.

00:02:49.367 --> 00:02:51.266
That's simply not true.

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.166
Our proposals cut hundreds
of billions of dollars in

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.367
unnecessary spending and
unwarranted giveaways to

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:00.500
insurance companies in
Medicare and Medicaid.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.266
They change incentives so
providers will give patients the

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:06.500
best care, not just the
most expensive care,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.166
which will mean big
savings over time.

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.900
And we've urged Congress
to include a proposal for a

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.066
standing commission of doctors
and medical experts to oversee

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:18.066
cost-savings measures.

00:03:18.066 --> 00:03:22.333
I want to be very clear: I will
not sign on to any health plan

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.433
that adds to our deficits
over the next decade.

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.266
And by helping improve
quality and efficiency,

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:31.934
the reforms we make will help
bring our deficits under control

00:03:31.934 --> 00:03:33.867
in the long-term.

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.600
Those who oppose reform will
also tell you that under our

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.033
plan, you won't get to
choose your doctor --

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:41.667
that some bureaucrat
will choose for you.

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.500
That's also not true.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.433
Michelle and I don't want anyone
telling us who our family doctor

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:50.033
should be -- and no one should decide that for you either.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:52.233
Under our proposal, if
you like your doctor,

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:53.867
you keep your doctor.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.867
If you like your
current insurance,

00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:57.834
you keep that insurance.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.367
Period, end of story.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:04.200
Finally, opponents of health
reform warn that this is all

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.400
some big plot for socialized
medicine or government-run

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.700
health care with long
lines and rationed care.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.533
That's not true either.

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:15.800
I don't believe that government
can or should run health care.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.667
But I also don't think insurance
companies should have free reign

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.700
to do as they please.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.233
That's why any plan I sign must
include an insurance exchange: a

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:27.900
one-stop shopping marketplace
where you can compare the

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.533
benefits, costs, and track records of a variety of plans --

00:04:32.533 --> 00:04:36.033
including a public option to
increase competition and keep

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:40.600
insurance companies honest -- and choose what's best for your family.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.100
And that's why we'll put an end
to the worst practices of the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.400
insurance industry: no more
yearly caps or lifetime caps;

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.533
no more denying people care
because of pre-existing

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:55.166
conditions; and no more dropping
people from a plan when they get too sick.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:57.867
No longer will you be
without health insurance,

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:01.100
even if you lose your
job or change your jobs.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.633
The good news is that people
who know the system best are

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:05.900
rallying to the cause of change.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.734
Just this past week, the
American Nurses Association,

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.333
representing millions of
nurses across America,

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.700
and the American
Medical Association,

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.233
representing doctors
across our nation,

00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:20.133
announced their support because
they've seen first-hand the need

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.300
for health insurance reform.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.600
They know we cannot continue
to cling to health industry

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.233
practices that are
bankrupting families,

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:31.867
and undermining American
businesses, large and small.

00:05:31.867 --> 00:05:35.400
They know we cannot let special
interests and partisan politics

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.800
stand in the way of reform
-- not this time around.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.333
The opponents of health
insurance reform would have us

00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:42.834
do nothing.

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:44.734
But think about
what doing nothing,

00:05:44.734 --> 00:05:47.033
in the face of ever
increasing costs,

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:49.300
will do to you and your family.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.233
So today, I'm urging
the House and the Senate,

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:55.800
Democrats and Republicans,
to seize this opportunity,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.133
and vote for reform that gives
the American people the best

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:03.300
care at the lowest cost; that
reins in insurance companies,

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.266
strengthens businesses and
finally gives families the

00:06:06.266 --> 00:06:10.367
choices they need and the
security they deserve.

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:11.500
Thanks.
