00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:08.600
President Obama:
This was a week for honoring
the extraordinary service and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.367
profound sacrifice of our
men and women in uniform.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.166
Every fall, we set aside a
special day to pay tribute

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:16.700
to our veterans.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.667
But this year, Veteran's Day
took on even greater poignancy

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.900
and meaning because of the
tragic events at Fort Hood.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.300
On Tuesday, I traveled there
to join with the Fort Hood

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.200
community, the Army, and the
friends and families of the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.300
victims to honor thirteen of our
fellow Americans who died - and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.500
the dozens more who were wounded
- not on some distant shore,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.900
but on a military base at home.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.734
Every man and woman who signs
up for military service does so

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.767
with full knowledge of the
dangers that could come - that

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.133
is part of what makes the
service of our troops and

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.367
veterans so extraordinary.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.500
But it's unthinkable that so
many would die in a hail of

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.233
gunfire on a US Army base
in the heart of Texas,

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.400
and that a fellow service-member
could have pulled trigger.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.834
There is an ongoing
investigation into

00:01:01.834 --> 00:01:03.467
this terrible tragedy.

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:05.667
That investigation will look
at the motives of the alleged

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.500
gunman, including his
views and contacts.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.300
As I said in Fort Hood, I am
confident that justice will be

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.166
done, and I will insist
that the full story be told.

00:01:15.166 --> 00:01:17.934
That is paramount, and I won't
compromise that investigation

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.166
today by discussing
the details of this case.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:24.033
But given the potential warning
signs that may have been known

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:27.066
prior to these shootings,
we must uncover what steps,

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.567
if any, could have been
taken to avert this tragedy.

00:01:30.567 --> 00:01:34.066
On the Thursday evening that
this tragedy took place,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.667
I met in the Oval Office with
Secretary of Defense Gates,

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.400
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff - Admiral Mullen,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.266
and FBI Director Mueller to
review the immediate steps that

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:46.000
were necessary to support the
families and secure Fort Hood.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.367
The next morning, I met with the
leadership of our military and

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.767
the intelligence community, and
ordered them to undertake a full

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:56.000
review of the sequence of events
that led up to the shootings.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.166
The purpose of this review is
clear: We must compile every

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:01.967
piece of information that
was known about the gunman,

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:05.266
and we must learn what was
done with that information.

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:08.033
Once we have those facts,
we must act upon them.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:11.233
If there was a failure to take
appropriate action before the

00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:14.000
shootings, there must
be accountability.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.066
Beyond that - and most
importantly - we must quickly

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:20.867
and thoroughly evaluate and
address any flaws in the system,

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.433
so that we can prevent a similar
breach from happening again.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.467
Our government must be able to
act swiftly and surely when it

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.400
has threatening information.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.633
And our troops must have the
security that they deserve.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:35.133
I know there will also be
inquiries by Congress,

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.500
and there should.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.800
But all of us should resist the
temptation to turn this tragic

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.533
event into the political theater
that sometimes dominates the

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.300
discussion here in Washington.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.333
The stakes are far too high.

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.700
Of all the responsibilities
of the presidency,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.767
the one that I weigh most
heavily is my duty as

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:54.300
Commander-in-Chief to our
splendid service-men and women.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.066
Their character and bravery
were on full display in that

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:00.266
processing center at Fort Hood,
when so many scrambled under

00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:02.633
fire to help their
wounded comrades.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:05.533
And their great dignity and
decency has been on display in

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:09.934
the days since, as the Fort Hood
community has rallied together.

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:13.166
We owe our troops prayerful,
considered decisions about when

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:16.100
and where we commit them to
battle to protect our security

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.800
and freedom, and we must
fully support them when

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.333
they are deployed.

00:03:20.333 --> 00:03:23.266
We also owe them the absolute
assurance that they'll be safe

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:26.800
here at home as they prepare
for whatever mission may come.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.133
As Commander-in-Chief, I won't
settle for anything less.

00:03:30.133 --> 00:03:33.033
This nation will never forget
the service of those we lost at

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.000
Fort Hood, just as we will
always honor the service of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.533
all who wear the uniform of
the United States of America.

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:43.333
Their legacy will be an America
that is safer and stronger -

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.233
an America that reflects the
extraordinary character of the

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:48.000
men and women who serve it.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.033
Thank you.
