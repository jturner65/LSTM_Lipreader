00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:07.700
The President:
Good morning.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.734
I want to briefly share
some news about our economy,

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:13.367
and talk about the work that
we're doing both to protect

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.600
American consumers, and to put our economy back on a path to

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.767
growth and prosperity.

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:21.533
This week, we saw some signs
that the gears of America's

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:24.967
economic engine are
slowly beginning to turn.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.166
Consumer spending and home
sales are stabilizing.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.934
Unemployment claims are
dropping and job losses are

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.066
beginning to slow.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.834
But these trends are
far from satisfactory.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:38.166
The unemployment rate is
at its highest point in

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:39.767
25 years.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.800
We're still in the midst of a
deep recession that was years in

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.333
the making, and it will
take time to fully turn this

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.367
economy around.

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.166
We cannot rest until
our work is done.

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.633
Not when Americans continue to
lose their jobs and struggle to

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.200
pay their bills.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.066
Not when we are wrestling
with record deficits and an

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.166
over-burdened middle class.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.233
And that's why every action that
my Administration is taking is

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:05.533
focused on clearing away the
wreckage of this recession,

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.800
and building a New Foundation
for job-creation and

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.600
long-term growth.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.233
This past week, we
acted on several fronts.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.734
To restart the flow of credit
that businesses and individuals

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:19.300
depend upon, we completed an
unprecedented review of the

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.700
conditions of our nation's
largest banks to determine what

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.667
additional steps are necessary
to get our economy moving.

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:31.266
To restore fiscal discipline,
we identified 121 programs to

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.533
eliminate from our budget.

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.433
And to restore a sense of
fairness to our tax code and

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.667
common sense to our economy, I've asked Congress to work with

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.300
me in closing the loopholes
that let companies ship jobs and

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.700
stash profits overseas; reforms that will help save $210 billion

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.467
over the next ten years.

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.367
These important steps are just
one part of a broad effort to

00:01:54.367 --> 00:01:58.133
get government, businesses, and
banks to act more responsibly,

00:01:58.133 --> 00:02:00.400
so that we're creating
good jobs and making sound

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.133
investments instead of
spending recklessly and padding

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.000
false profits.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.734
Because American institutions
must act with the same sense of

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.767
responsibility and fairness that
the American people aspire to in

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.133
their own lives.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.066
Nowhere is this more
apparent than in our credit

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:17.667
card industry.

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.400
Americans know that they have
a responsibility to live within

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.767
their means and
pay what they owe.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:24.934
But they also have a right not to get ripped off by the sudden

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.633
rate hikes, unfair penalties,
and hidden fees that have become

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.967
all-too common in our
credit card industry.

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:34.166
You shouldn't have to fear that
any new credit card is going to

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:37.433
come with strings attached, nor
should you need a magnifying

00:02:37.433 --> 00:02:41.834
glass and a reference book to
read a credit card application.

00:02:41.834 --> 00:02:44.200
And the abuses in our credit
card industry have only

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.467
multiplied in the midst
of this recession,

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:50.233
when Americans can least
afford to bear an extra burden.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:53.600
It is past time for rules
that are fair and transparent.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.166
And that's why I've called for a
set of new principles to reform

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:58.367
our credit card industry.

00:02:58.367 --> 00:03:00.500
Instead of an "anything
goes" approach,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.800
we need strong and reliable
protections for consumers.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.200
Instead of fine print
that hides the truth,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.600
we need credit card forms and
statements that have plain

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.033
language in plain sight, and we
need to give people the tools

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.600
they need to find a credit
card that meets their needs.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.967
And instead of abuse
that goes unpunished,

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:20.633
we need to strengthen
monitoring, enforcement,

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.967
and penalties for credit card
companies that take advantage of

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:26.400
ordinary Americans.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.333
Now, the House has taken important steps towards putting

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.367
these principles into law, and the Senate is poised to do the

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.333
same next week.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.700
Now, I'm calling on Congress
to take final action to pass a

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.333
credit card reform bill that
protects American consumers so

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:43.600
that I can sign it into
law by Memorial Day.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.300
There's no time for delay.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.200
We need a durable and successful
flow of credit in our economy,

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.233
but we can't tolerate profits
that depend on misleading

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:53.700
working families.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.767
Those days are over.

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:58.266
Now, this economic crisis has
reminded us that we're all in

00:03:58.266 --> 00:03:59.834
this together.

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:02.367
We can't prosper by
putting off hard choices,

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:05.667
or by protecting the profits of
the few at the expense of the

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:07.367
middle class.

00:04:07.367 --> 00:04:09.800
We're making steady
progress towards recovery,

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.266
but we must ensure that the
legacy of this recession is an

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:16.834
American economy that
rewards work and innovation;

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:19.800
that's guided by fairness
and responsibility;

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.934
and that grows steadily
into the future.

00:04:22.934 --> 00:04:24.166
Thanks.
