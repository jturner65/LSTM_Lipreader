00:00:06.734 --> 00:00:10.133
The President:
As we continue to recover from an historic economic crisis,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.100
it's clear to everyone that
one of its major causes was a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.533
breakdown in oversight that led
to widespread abuses in the

00:00:16.533 --> 00:00:18.433
financial system.

00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.633
An epidemic of irresponsibility
took hold from Wall Street to

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.700
Washington to Main Street.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.533
And the consequences
have been disastrous.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:29.834
Millions of Americans have
seen their life savings erode;

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.467
families have been
devastated by job losses;

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:36.166
businesses large and small
have closed their doors.

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:39.367
In response, this week, my
administration proposed a set of

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.066
major reforms to the rules that
govern our financial system;

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.967
to attack the causes of this
crisis and to prevent future

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:49.934
crises from taking place; to
ensure that our markets can work

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:54.066
fairly and freely for
businesses and consumers alike.

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.367
We're going to promote markets
that work for those who play by the rules.

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.633
We're going to stand up for a
system in which fair dealing and

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.667
honest competition are
the only way to win.

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:05.266
We're going to level the
playing field for consumers.

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.667
And we're going to have the
kinds of rules that encourage

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.667
innovations that make
our economy stronger --

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:15.433
not those that allow insiders to exploit its weaknesses for their own gain.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.133
And one of the most important
proposals is a new oversight

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:22.200
agency called the Consumer
Financial Protection Agency.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.500
It's charged with just one job:
looking out for the interests of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.667
ordinary Americans in
the financial system.

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:32.300
This is essential, for this
crisis may have started on Wall Street.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300
But its impacts have been felt
by ordinary Americans who rely

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.667
on credit cards, home loans, and
other financial instruments.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:43.000
It's true that this crisis was
caused in part by Americans who

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.834
took on too much debt and took
out loans they simply could not afford.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.400
But there are also millions of
Americans who signed contracts

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.633
they didn't always understand
offered by lenders who didn't

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.467
always tell the truth.

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.433
Today, folks signing up for
a mortgage, student loan,

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.066
or credit card face a
bewildering array of

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:02.467
incomprehensible options.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.333
Companies compete not by
offering better products,

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:10.266
but more complicated ones --
with more fine print and hidden terms.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:12.867
It's no coincidence that
the lack of strong consumer

00:02:12.867 --> 00:02:16.166
protections led to abuses
against consumers;

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.133
the lack of rules to stop
deceptive lending practices led

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.533
to abuses against borrowers.

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:24.600
This new agency will have the
responsibility to change that.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.967
It will have the power to
set tough new rules so that

00:02:26.967 --> 00:02:29.834
companies compete by offering
innovative products that

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:33.133
consumers actually want --
and actually understand.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:36.200
Those ridiculous contracts --
pages of fine print that no one

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.166
can figure out -- will
be a thing of the past.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:40.800
You'll be able to
compare products --

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.800
with descriptions
in plain language --

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.967
to see what is best for you.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:48.000
The most unfair
practices will be banned.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700
And the rules will be enforced.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.633
Now, some argue
that these changes --

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.033
and the many others we've
called for -- go too far.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:59.734
I welcome a debate about how we can make sure our regulations

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:02.633
work for businesses
and consumers.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:06.667
But what I will not accept --
what I will vigorously oppose --

00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.333
are those who do not
argue in good faith.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:12.433
Those who would defend the
status quo at any cost.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.567
Those who put their narrow
interests ahead of the interests

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:17.600
of ordinary Americans.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.033
We've already begun to see
special interests mobilizing

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.700
against change.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
And that's not surprising.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.133
That's Washington.

00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:26.967
For these are interests that
have benefited from a system

00:03:26.967 --> 00:03:30.233
which allow ordinary
Americans to be exploited.

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:33.000
These interests argue against
reform even as millions of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.967
people are facing the
consequences of this crisis in

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:37.400
their own lives.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.033
These interests defend
business-as-usual even though we

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.200
know that it was
business-as-usual that allowed

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900
this crisis to take place.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.633
Well, the American people did
not send me to Washington to

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:49.633
give in to those
special interests;

00:03:49.633 --> 00:03:53.633
the American people sent me to
Washington to stand up for their interests.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:57.000
And while I'm not spoiling for
a fight, I'm ready for one.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.834
The most important thing we
can do to put this era of

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:05.033
irresponsibility in the past
is to take responsibility now.

00:04:05.033 --> 00:04:07.900
That's why my administration will accept no less than real

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.133
and lasting change to the
way business is done --

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:13.633
on Wall Street
and in Washington.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:16.400
We will do what is necessary
to end this crisis --

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.233
and we will do what it takes to prevent this kind of crisis from

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:21.100
ever happening again.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.667
Thank you.
