00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.177
The Vice President: Ladies and Gentlemen, this

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.113
is Joe Biden and I'm here filling in for President Obama,

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:15.382
who is traveling abroad.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:18.818
And I'm here with a simple
message: middle-class

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.854
economics works.

00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:24.290
Our economy has gone from
crisis to recovery to now to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.361
resurgence-with the longest
streak of consecutive job

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.399
growth ever recorded in the
history of this country and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.901
more than all other advanced
countries combined.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:38.238
But to make sure everyone is
part of this resurgence,

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:41.508
we need to build on what we
know widens the path to the

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:44.043
middle class-and you all
know what it is,

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.212
access to education.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:48.515
Folks, the source of our
economic power and middle

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.584
class strength in the 20th
Century was the fact that we

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.820
were among the first major
nations in the world to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.557
provide twelve years of free
education for our citizens.

00:00:57.557 --> 00:01:00.393
But in the 21st Century,
other countries have already

00:01:00.393 --> 00:01:03.897
caught up and twelve years
is simply no longer enough-a

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.434
minimum of fourteen years is
necessary for families to

00:01:07.434 --> 00:01:09.736
have a surer path to the
middle class and for the

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:12.405
United States to be able to
out-compete the rest of

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:13.406
the world.

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.942
Consider that by the end of
the decade,

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:19.446
two out of three of all jobs
will require an education

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:23.049
beyond high school, from an
18-week certificate to a

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.686
two-year associate's degree
to a four-year bachelor's,

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:28.822
or a PhD.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:31.991
And consider that folks with
an associate's degree earn

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:34.928
25% more than someone who
graduated just from

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.229
high school.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.898
And folks who graduate with
a four-year degree make

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.667
70% more.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.903
But today, the cost of
higher education is too high

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.773
for too many Americans.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.876
Too many folks are priced
out of a piece of the

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:50.877
middle-class dream.

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.546
And that's why the President
and I have a straightforward

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:57.016
plan to remove that barrier
and expand the pathway to

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.786
the middle class-by bringing
the cost of community

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.823
colleges down-down to zero.

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:06.893
Zero-for anyone willing to
work for it and for the

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:10.396
institutions that meet
certain basic requirements.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.432
Our plan is no give-away.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.301
Students must keep up their
grades and stay on track

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.636
to graduate.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.506
States must contribute
funding and hold community

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:22.041
colleges accountable for the
results.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.879
And community colleges must
maintain high graduation and

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.980
job placement rates.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.149
And here's a key
point-community colleges

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.352
will have to offer courses
that are directly

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:35.355
transferrable to a four-year
degree.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.725
If two years of community
college are free-and credits

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.027
can transfer to a four-year
university-that means the

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:44.631
cost of a four-year degree
will be cut in half for a

00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.799
lot of working families
struggling to send their

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.802
children to college,
qualified children.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.405
And under our plan, students
from low-income families

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.774
will be able to keep the
benefits that flow from

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:56.776
other financial aid, like
Pell grants,

00:02:56.776 --> 00:03:00.413
to cover childcare, housing,
transportation-costs that

00:03:00.413 --> 00:03:03.883
often keep them from
attending class and

00:03:03.883 --> 00:03:06.219
completing a degree in the
first place.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.854
But here's another key
point.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.657
Not every good-paying job
will require a two-year or

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:12.425
four-year degree.

00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.694
Some of these jobs will
require just a training

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.730
certificate that can be
earned in just a few months.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.968
For example, you can go to
an 18-week coding

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:25.972
bootcamp-with no previous
experience in computers-and

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:29.976
become a computer programmer
making up to $70,000 a year.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:32.679
There are other jobs in
fields like advanced

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.683
manufacturing and energy
that pay $40,000, $50,000,

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:41.521
$60,000 a year-jobs you can
raise a family on.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.656
It's a simple fact that
community colleges are the

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:47.994
most flexible educational
institutions we have.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.996
I've traveled all over this
country,

00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:51.998
from New York to Iowa to
California,

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:54.267
to see how community
colleges create partnerships

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:57.704
with Fortune 500 companies
and local businesses to

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:01.007
generate jobs; support
apprenticeships with

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.943
organized labor, and prepare
hardworking students for

00:04:03.943 --> 00:04:07.580
good-paying jobs in the
areas in which they live.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.551
Making community colleges
free is good for workers,

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.821
it's good for companies, and
it's good for our economy.

00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:18.625
Here's what we propose:
Close loopholes for the

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:20.893
wealthiest investors and
levy a .

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:25.732
07% fee on the biggest banks
to discourage the kind of

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:28.868
risky behavior that crashed
our economy just a few

00:04:28.868 --> 00:04:30.603
years ago.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:34.374
Doing just that would pay
for free community

00:04:34.374 --> 00:04:37.777
college-and provide a leg up
for working families through

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:41.781
tax credits to cover
necessities like childcare.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.916
That's what middle-class
economics is all

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:47.620
about-giving folks a fair
chance to get ahead.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.621
A fair tax code.

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:49.622
No guarantees.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.824
Just a fair chance.

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:55.094
It's simple folks, two years
of community college should

00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.964
become as free and as
universal as high school is

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.801
today if we're to make this
economic resurgence

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:04.604
permanent and well into the
21st Century.

00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:06.939
So I want to thank you all
for listening.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.676
I hope you have a great
weekend and God bless you

00:05:09.676 --> 00:05:11.678
all and may God protect our
troops.
