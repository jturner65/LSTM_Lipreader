00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.667
MR. PRESIDENT: Good morning.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.633
Over the last three months,
my Administration has taken

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:14.100
aggressive action to confront
an historic economic crisis.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.467
As we do everything that we
can to create jobs and get our

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:19.500
economy moving, we're also
building a new foundation for

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.567
lasting prosperity - a
foundation that invests in

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:26.567
quality education, lowers health
care costs, and develops new

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.600
sources of energy powered
by new jobs and industries.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.800
One of the pillars of that
foundation must be fiscal discipline.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.667
We came into office facing a
budget deficit of $1.3 trillion

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:43.900
for this year alone, and the
cost of confronting our economic crisis is high.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.734
But we cannot settle for a
future of rising deficits and

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.000
debts that our
children cannot pay.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.433
All across America, families
are tightening their belts and making hard choices.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.633
Now, Washington must show that
same sense of responsibility.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.967
That is why we have identified
two trillion dollars in

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:04.066
deficit-reductions over the
next decade, while taking on the

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:08.133
special interest spending that
doesn't advance the peoples' interests.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.367
But we must also recognize that
we cannot meet the challenges of

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.166
today with old habits
and stale thinking.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:16.467
So much of our government was
built to deal with different

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:18.400
challenges from a different era.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.100
Too often, the result is
wasteful spending, bloated

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.300
programs, and
inefficient results.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.266
It's time to fundamentally
change the way that we do

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.066
business in Washington.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:31.600
To help build a new foundation
for the 21st century, we need to

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.834
reform our government so that
it is more efficient, more

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.300
transparent, and more creative.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.200
That will demand new
thinking and a new sense of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400
responsibility for every
dollar that is spent.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.000
Earlier this week, I held my
first Cabinet meeting and sent a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.867
clear message: cut
what doesn't work.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:50.500
Already, we've identified
substantial savings.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.266
And in the days and weeks ahead,
we will continue going through

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.367
the budget line by line, and
we'll identify more than 100

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:59.900
programs that will
be cut or eliminated.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.500
But we can't stop there.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.033
We need to go further, and
we need an all-hands-on-deck

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.500
approach to
reforming government.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.367
That's why I'm announcing
several steps that my

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:11.400
Administration will take in the
weeks ahead to restore fiscal

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.333
discipline while making
our government work better.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:19.000
First, we need to adhere to the
basic principle that new tax or

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.300
entitlement policies
should be paid for.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.500
This principle - known as
PAYGO - helped transform large

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.700
deficits into
surpluses in the 1990s.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.400
Now, we must restore that
sense of fiscal discipline.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.266
That's why I'm calling
on Congress to pass PAYGO

00:02:35.266 --> 00:02:37.467
legislation like a bill
that will be introduced by

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:41.100
Congressman Baron Hill, so that
government acts the same way any

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.767
responsible family does
in setting its budget.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.400
Second, we'll create new
incentives to reduce wasteful

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.333
spending and to
invest in what works.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.834
We don't want agencies to
protect bloated budgets - we

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.834
want them to promote
effective programs.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:59.500
So the idea is simple: agencies
that identify savings will get

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.900
to keep a portion of those
savings to invest in programs that work.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.533
The result will be a smaller
budget, and a more effective government.

00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:11.900
Third, we'll look for
ideas from the bottom up.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.967
After all, Americans across the
country know that the best ideas

00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:18.367
often come from workers
- not just management.

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.834
That's why we'll establish a
process through which every

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:24.233
government worker can submit
their ideas for how their agency

00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.900
can save money and
perform better.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.667
We'll put the suggestions
that work into practice.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.166
And later this year, I will meet
with those who come up with the

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:35.967
best ideas to hear firsthand
about how they would make your

00:03:35.967 --> 00:03:38.934
government more
efficient and effective.

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:42.500
And finally, we will reach
beyond the halls of government.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.266
Many businesses have innovative
ways of using technology to save

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:50.100
money, and many experts have new
ideas to make government work more efficiently.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.900
Government can - and
must - learn from them.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.834
So later this year, we will host
a forum on reforming government

00:03:56.834 --> 00:04:02.900
for the 21st century, so that
we're also guided by voices that come from outside of Washington.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.033
We cannot sustain deficits that
mortgage our children's future,

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.734
nor tolerate wasteful
inefficiency.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:11.700
Government has a responsibility
to spend the peoples' money

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.200
wisely, and to serve
the people effectively.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.100
I will work every single day
that I am President to live up

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.800
to that responsibility, and to
transform our government so that

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.066
is held to a higher standard
of performance on behalf of the American people.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.734
Thank you.
