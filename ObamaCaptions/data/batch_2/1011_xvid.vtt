00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.033
MR. PRESIDENT: It's not
news to say that we're living

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:09.967
through challenging times.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.900
The worst economic downturn
since the Great Depression.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.800
A credit crisis that's made that
downturn worse.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.133
And a fiscal disaster that has
accumulated over a period of years.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.200
In the year 2000, we had
projected budget surpluses in

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.767
the trillions, and Washington
appeared to be on the road to fiscal stability.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.433
Eight years later, and when I
walked in the door, the

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:35.433
projected budget deficit for
this year alone was 1.3 trillion.

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:37.934
And in order to jumpstart our
struggling economy, we were

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:41.000
forced to make investments that
added to that deficit through

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.600
the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.033
But as surely as our future
depends on building a new energy

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.400
economy, controlling health care
costs, and ensuring that our

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.066
kids are once again the best
educated in the world, it also

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:55.633
depends on restoring a sense of
responsibility and

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:58.333
accountability to our federal
budget.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:01.367
Without significant change to
steer away from ever-expanding

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:06.533
deficits and debt, we are on an
unsustainable course.

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.467
So today, we simply can't afford
to perpetuate a system in

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.600
Washington where politicians and
bureaucrats make decisions

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.533
behind closed doors with little
accountability for the consequences.

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.200
Where billions are squandered on
programs that have outlived

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.934
their usefulness or exist solely
because of the power of the

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:24.467
lobbyist or interest group.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.266
And where outdated technology
and information systems

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:33.233
undermine efficiency, threaten
our security, and fail to serve an engaged citizenry.

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.533
If we're going to rebuild our
economy on a solid foundation,

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.500
we need to change the way we do
business in Washington.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800
We need to restore the American
people's confidence in their

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.633
government, that it is on their
side, spending their money

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.033
wisely, to meet their family's
needs.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.934
That starts with the painstaking
work of examining every program,

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:56.567
every entitlement, every dollar
of government spending, and

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:00.233
asking ourselves, is this
program really essential?

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:02.533
Are taxpayers getting their
money's worth?

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.567
Can we accomplish our goals more
efficiently, more effectively

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:06.800
some other way?

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.934
It's a process we've already
begun, scouring our budget line

00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:13.200
by line for programs that don't
work so we can cut them to make

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.100
room for ones that do.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.800
That means ending tax breaks for
companies shipping jobs overseas.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.867
Stopping the fraud and abuse in
our Medicare program and

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:26.166
reforming our health care system
to cut costs for families and businesses.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.533
It means strengthening
whistle-blower protections for

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:32.433
government employees who step
forward to report wasteful spending.

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:35.300
And it means reinstating the
pay-as-you-go rule that we

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.233
followed during the 1990s.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:41.400
So if we want to spend, we need
to find somewhere else to cut.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.433
And this Monday, in my first
full Cabinet meeting, I will ask

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.967
all my department and agency
heads for specific proposals for

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.834
cutting their budgets.

00:02:49.834 --> 00:02:52.100
Already, members of my Cabinet
have begun to trim back

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.066
unnecessary expenditures.

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:56.633
Secretary Napolitano, for
example, is ending consulting

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.767
contracts to create new seals
and logos that have cost the

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:04.633
Department of Homeland Security
$3 million since 2003.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:07.166
In the largest department,
Secretary Gates has launched a

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.767
historic project to reform
defense contracting procedures

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.233
and eliminate hundreds of
billions of dollars in wasteful

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.567
spending and cost overruns.

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:18.834
And I commend Senators McCain
and Levin, a Republican and a

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:23.133
Democrat, who have teamed up to
lead this effort in Congress.

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:25.900
Finally, in the coming weeks, I
will be announcing the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.200
elimination of dozens of
government programs shown to be

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.100
wasteful or ineffective.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.200
In this effort, there will be no
sacred cows and no pet projects.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.433
All across America, families are
making hard choices, and it's

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:40.734
time their government did the
same.

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.900
And that's why I've assembled a
team of management, technology

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.033
and budget experts to guide us
in this work.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.033
Leaders who will help us revamp
government operations from top

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.233
to bottom, and ensure that the
Federal Government is truly

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:55.533
working for the American people.

00:03:55.533 --> 00:03:58.734
I've named Jeffrey Zients, a
leading CEO, management

00:03:58.734 --> 00:04:02.166
consultant and entrepreneur, to
serve as Deputy Director for

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:05.800
Management of the Office of
Management and Budget, and as

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.734
the first ever Chief Performance
Officer.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:13.200
Jeffrey will work to streamline
processes, cut costs, and find

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.800
best practices throughout our
government.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.400
Aneesh Chopra, who is currently
the Secretary of Technology for

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.533
Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia,
has agreed to serve as America's

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.333
Chief Technology Officer.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:26.567
In this role, Aneesh will
promote technological innovation

00:04:26.567 --> 00:04:29.734
to help achieve our most urgent
priorities, from creating jobs

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:33.800
and reducing health care costs,
to keeping our nation secure.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.066
Aneesh and Jeffrey will work
closely with our Chief

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:39.834
Information Officer, Vivek
Kundra, who is responsible for

00:04:39.834 --> 00:04:42.867
setting technology policy across
the government, and using

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:47.633
technology to improve security,
ensure transparency and lower costs.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:50.100
The goal is to give all
Americans a voice in their

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.300
government, and ensure that they
know exactly how we're spending

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.000
their money and can hold us
accountable for the results.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.500
None of this will be easy. Big change never is.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.633
But with the leadership of these
individuals, I am confident that

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:06.800
we can break our bad habits, put
an end to the mismanagement that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.734
has plagued our government, and
start living within our means again.

00:05:10.734 --> 00:05:13.333
That's how we will get our
deficits under control and move

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.567
from recovery to prosperity.

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.633
And that's how we will give the
American people the kind of

00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:20.266
government they expect and
deserve.

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:24.800
One that's efficient,
accountable, and fully worthy of their trust.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.700
Thank you.
