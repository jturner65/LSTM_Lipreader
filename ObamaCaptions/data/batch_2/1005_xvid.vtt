00:00:05.186 --> 00:00:07.546
Yesterday began with some
devastating news with regard

00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:08.726
to our economic crisis.

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:11.596
But I'm pleased to say it
ended on a more positive note.

00:00:12.706 --> 00:00:14.846
In the morning, we
received yet another round

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:16.476
of alarming employment
figures --

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:18.766
the worst in more
than 30 years.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.156
Another 600,000 jobs
were lost in January.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.106
We've now lost more
than 3.6 million jobs

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:27.736
since this recession began.

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:32.056
But by the evening, Democrats
and Republicans came together

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:33.946
in the Senate and
responded appropriately

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:36.236
to the urgency this
moment demands.

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.286
In the midst of our
greatest economic crisis

00:00:38.286 --> 00:00:41.316
since the Great Depression,
the American people were hoping

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:42.776
that Congress would begin

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.816
to confront the great
challenges we face.

00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:47.886
That was, after all, what
last November's election was

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:48.346
all about.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:51.346
Legislation of such magnitude
deserves the scrutiny

00:00:51.346 --> 00:00:52.826
that it's received
over the last month,

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:55.266
and it will receive more
in the days to come.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:00:58.746
But we can't afford to
make perfect the enemy

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:00.186
of the absolutely necessary.

00:01:00.956 --> 00:01:03.426
The scale and scope
of this plan is right.

00:01:03.746 --> 00:01:05.526
And the time for action is now.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.716
Because if we don't move
swiftly to put this plan

00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:11.446
in motion, our economic
crisis could become a

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.736
national catastrophe.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:16.896
Millions of Americans will
lose their jobs, their homes,

00:01:17.156 --> 00:01:17.946
and their health care.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.286
Millions more will have to
put their dreams on hold.

00:01:21.606 --> 00:01:24.196
Let's be clear: We
can't expect relief

00:01:24.386 --> 00:01:27.496
from the tired old theories
that, in eight short years,

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:29.936
doubled the national
debt, threw our economy

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:31.806
into a tailspin, and led us

00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:33.526
into this mess in
the first place.

00:01:34.276 --> 00:01:36.046
We can't rely on
a losing formula

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:38.426
that offers only tax
cuts as the answer

00:01:38.426 --> 00:01:41.676
to all our problems while
ignoring our fundamental

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:44.616
economic challenges -- the
crushing cost of health care

00:01:45.096 --> 00:01:48.366
or the inadequate state of so
many schools; our addiction

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:51.246
to foreign oil or our crumbling
roads, bridges, and levees.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:54.466
The American people know that
our challenges are great.

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:56.766
They don't expect
Democratic solutions

00:01:56.766 --> 00:02:00.306
or Republican solutions --
they expect American solutions.

00:02:00.706 --> 00:02:03.526
From the beginning, this
recovery plan has had

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:06.846
at its core a simple
idea: Let's put Americans

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:09.096
to work doing the work
America needs done.

00:02:09.456 --> 00:02:12.256
It will save or create
more than 3 million jobs

00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:14.516
over the next two years,
all across the country --

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:18.776
16,000 in Maine, nearly
80,000 in Indiana --

00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:21.416
almost all of them in
the private sector,

00:02:21.806 --> 00:02:24.746
and all of them jobs that
help us recover today,

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:26.006
and prosper tomorrow.

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:29.356
Jobs that upgrade
classrooms and laboratories

00:02:29.356 --> 00:02:31.066
in 10,000 schools nationwide --

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:33.766
at least 485 in
Florida alone --

00:02:34.436 --> 00:02:37.246
and train an army of
teachers in math and science.

00:02:37.966 --> 00:02:40.216
Jobs that modernize
our health care system,

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:44.046
not only saving us billions of
dollars, but countless lives.

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:47.186
Jobs that construct a
smart electric grid,

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:49.296
connect every corner
of the country

00:02:49.296 --> 00:02:50.916
to the information
superhighway,

00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:54.206
double our capacity to
generate renewable energy,

00:02:54.536 --> 00:02:56.246
and grow the economy
of tomorrow.

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:00.226
Jobs that rebuild our crumbling
roads, bridges and levees

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:02.846
and dams, so that the
tragedies of New Orleans

00:03:02.846 --> 00:03:04.776
and Minneapolis
never happen again.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.296
It includes immediate
tax relief

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.676
for our struggling middle
class in places like Ohio,

00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:13.476
where 4.5 million workers
will receive a tax cut

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.496
of up to $1,000.

00:03:16.136 --> 00:03:17.376
It protects health insurance

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:18.896
and provides unemployment
insurance

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:20.736
for those who've
lost their jobs.

00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:22.466
And it helps our states

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:26.346
and communities avoid
painful tax hikes or layoffs

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:29.706
for our teachers, nurses,
and first responders.

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.756
That's what is at
stake with this plan:

00:03:32.356 --> 00:03:33.856
putting Americans back to work,

00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:37.636
creating transformative
economic change, and making a

00:03:37.636 --> 00:03:40.676
down payment on the American
Dream that serves our children

00:03:40.676 --> 00:03:43.736
and our children's children
for generations to come.

00:03:44.976 --> 00:03:46.846
Americans across this
country are struggling,

00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:49.506
and they are watching
to see if we're equal

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:50.616
to the task before us.

00:03:51.546 --> 00:03:52.656
Let's show them that we are.

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.266
And let's do whatever it
takes to keep the promise

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.326
of America alive in our time.

00:03:59.166 --> 00:03:59.526
Thank you.
