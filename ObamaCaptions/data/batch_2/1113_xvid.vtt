00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.533
The President:
Each week, I've spoken with you
about the challenges we face as

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.867
a nation and the path we
must take to meet them.

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:14.266
And the truth is, over
the past ten months,

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.133
I've often had to report
distressing news during what has

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.767
been a difficult
time for our country.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.800
But today, I am pleased to
offer some better news that --

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.700
while not a cause
for celebration --

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.266
is certainly reason to believe
that we are moving in the right direction.

00:00:28.266 --> 00:00:30.934
On Thursday, we received a
report on our Gross Domestic

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:33.000
Product, or GDP.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.500
This is an important measure
of our economy as a whole,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.367
one that tells us how much
we are producing and how much

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.800
businesses and
families are earning.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
We learned that the economy grew
for the first time in more than

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.967
a year and faster than at any
point in the previous two years.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.433
So while we have a long way
to go before we return to

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.033
prosperity, and there will
undoubtedly be ups and downs

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:57.333
along the road, it's also true
that we've come a long way.

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.567
It's easy to forget that it was
only several months ago that the

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:03.433
economy was shrinking rapidly
and many economists feared

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:04.800
another Great Depression.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.633
Now, economic growth is no
substitute for job growth.

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.700
And we will likely see further
job losses in the coming days,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.767
a fact that's both
troubling for our economy and

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.934
heartbreaking for the men
and women who suddenly find

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.867
themselves out of work.

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.033
But we will not create the jobs
we need unless the economy is

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:24.066
growing; that's why this
GDP report is a good sign.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.333
And we can see clearly now that
the steps my administration is

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.300
taking are making a difference,
blunting the worst of this

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.867
recession and helping to
bring about its conclusion.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.367
We've acted aggressively to
jumpstart credit for families

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:39.033
and businesses, including
small businesses,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.700
which have seen an
increase in lending of 73%.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.166
We've taken steps to stem
the tide of foreclosures,

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.533
modifying mortgages to help
hundreds of thousands of

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.800
responsible homeowners keep
their homes and help millions

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.734
more sustain the
value in their homes.

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:58.433
And the Recovery Act is spurring
demand through a tax cut for 95%

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.100
of working families, and through
assistance for seniors and those

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.567
who've lost jobs -- which not only helps folks hit hardest by

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.266
the downturn, but also encourages the consumer spending

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:11.533
that will help turn
the economy around.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:14.166
Finally, the Recovery Act is
saving and creating jobs all

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.834
across the country.

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:18.633
Just this week, we reached
an important milestone.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.200
Based on reports coming
in from across America --

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.867
as shovels break ground, as
needed public servants are

00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:26.867
rehired, and as
factories whir to life --

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:30.667
it is clear that the Recovery
Act has now created and saved

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:32.867
more than one million jobs.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:35.100
That's more than a million
people who might otherwise be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.300
out of work today -- folks who can wake up each day knowing

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.400
that they'll be able to provide for themselves and for their families.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.033
We've saved jobs by closing
state budget shortfalls to

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:48.467
prevent the layoffs of hundreds
of thousands of police officers,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:51.900
firefighters, and teachers who
are today on the beat, on call,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.667
and in the classrooms
because of the Recovery Act.

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.200
And we've also created hundreds
of thousands of jobs through the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.066
largest investment in our
roads since the building of the

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:04.066
interstate highway system, and through the largest investment

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:09.000
in education, medical research,
and clean energy in history.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.066
These investments aren't just
helping us recover in the short

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:14.400
term, they're helping to lay
a new foundation for lasting

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.200
prosperity in the long term -- and they're giving hardworking,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200
middle-class Americans the chance to succeed and raise a family.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.233
Because the investments we've
made and the steps we've taken,

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.633
it's easier for middle-class
families to send their kids to

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:31.000
college and get the training and
skills they need to compete in a

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.500
global economy.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.934
We're making it easier for these
families to save for retirement.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:38.467
And in areas like clean energy,
we're creating the jobs of the

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:42.600
future -- jobs that pay
well and can't be outsourced.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.800
In fact, just this week,
I traveled to Arcadia,

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.300
Florida to announce the largest
set of clean energy projects

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.767
through the Recovery Act so
far: one hundred grants for

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.834
businesses, utilities,
manufacturers,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.100
cities and other partners across
the country to put thousands of

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.834
people to work modernizing
our electric grid --

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.834
the system that provides power
to our homes and businesses --

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.400
so that it wastes less energy,
helps integrate renewables like

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.700
wind and solar, and
saves consumers money.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.367
And that's just one example.

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:14.834
So, we have made progress.

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:16.900
At the same time, I want to
emphasize that there's still

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.967
plenty of progress to be made.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.967
For we know that positive news
for the economy as a whole means

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:25.100
little if you've lost your
job and can't find another,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.533
if you can't afford health
care or the mortgage,

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.100
if you do not see in your own
life the improvement we're

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.900
seeing in these
economic statistics.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.200
And positive news today doesn't
mean there won't be difficult

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.567
days ahead.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.533
As I've said many times, it took
years to dig our way into the

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:41.500
crisis we've faced.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.600
It will take more than a few
months to dig our way out.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.100
But make no mistake: that's
exactly what we will do.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.166
For the economy we seek is one
where folks who need a job can

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.934
find one and incomes
are rising again.

00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:56.600
The economy we seek is one where
small businesses can flourish

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.700
and entrepreneurs can get the
capital they need to plant new

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.433
seeds of growth.

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:03.967
The economy we seek is one
that's no longer based on maxed

00:05:03.967 --> 00:05:06.700
out credits cards,
wild speculation,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.834
and the old cycles
of boom or bust --

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:12.033
but rather one that is
built on a solid foundation,

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:14.734
supporting growth
that's strong, sustained,

00:05:14.734 --> 00:05:18.533
and broadly shared by middle
class families across America.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.000
That's what we're working
toward every single day.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.834
And we will not stop
until we get there.

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:24.600
Thanks.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.800
And Happy Halloween.
