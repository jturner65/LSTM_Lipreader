00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:15.594
The President:
Over the past few decades, there has been an intense struggle in

00:00:15.594 --> 00:00:18.895
Washington between the lobbyists
for the insurance industry and

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.761
the interests of the American
people over what's been called

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:24.594
a Patient's Bill of Rights
-- a set of rules to protect

00:00:24.594 --> 00:00:27.294
Americans from some of the
worst practices of the health

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:30.695
insurance industry; rules to ensure that all Americans are

00:00:30.695 --> 00:00:33.928
getting the care they need from their doctors and the care they

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:37.094
deserve from their
insurance companies.

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:39.494
The last time a Patient's Bill
of Rights was within reach was

00:00:39.494 --> 00:00:42.594
roughly a decade ago, and it
was supported by Democrats and

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:46.695
Republicans alike, from
Ted Kennedy to John McCain.

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:48.861
It included the right to an
appeals process so you could

00:00:48.861 --> 00:00:52.227
challenge an unfair decision by
an insurance company before a

00:00:52.227 --> 00:00:53.561
third party.

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:55.861
It included the right to
choose your own doctor.

00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.227
It included the right to access
information about what your

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.261
health insurance
plan means for you.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.994
And it called for a new level
of transparency so that patients

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:07.027
would know if their doctor had
a conflict of interest when

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:08.594
providing services.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:11.328
Now, this Patient's Bill of
Rights never made it into law.

00:01:11.328 --> 00:01:13.194
It fell victim --
again and again --

00:01:13.194 --> 00:01:15.761
to the same special interest
lobbying that has blocked

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:19.428
passage of health insurance
reform for so many decades.

00:01:19.428 --> 00:01:22.094
But today, we're being given
another chance to make it a

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:25.961
reality, because each of
these rights, and many more,

00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.828
are incorporated in the health
insurance reform bill that

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:32.027
recently passed the House of
Representatives and in the bill

00:01:32.027 --> 00:01:35.161
that is currently making
its way through the Senate.

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.227
Both the House and the Senate bills would make it against the

00:01:38.227 --> 00:01:41.461
law for insurance companies to deny you coverage on the basis

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.895
of a pre-existing
condition or illness.

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:47.261
Both would stop insurers from
charging exorbitant premiums on

00:01:47.261 --> 00:01:50.061
the basis of age,
health, or gender.

00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:52.328
Both would prevent insurance
companies from dropping your

00:01:52.328 --> 00:01:54.461
coverage when you get sick.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:57.328
And both would put a limit on
how much you have to pay out of

00:01:57.328 --> 00:02:02.061
pocket for the treatments you
need in a year or lifetime.

00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:05.094
Simply put, the protections
currently included in both the

00:02:05.094 --> 00:02:07.994
health insurance reform bill
passed by the House and the

00:02:07.994 --> 00:02:10.961
version currently on the Senate
floor would represent the

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:14.194
toughest measures we've ever
taken to hold the insurance

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:16.061
industry accountable.

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:19.394
Anyone who says otherwise
simply hasn't read the bills.

00:02:19.394 --> 00:02:23.094
Just open these proposals at
random and you'll find on almost

00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:27.394
any page patient protections
that dwarf any of those passed

00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:29.928
by Congress in at
least a decade.

00:02:29.928 --> 00:02:32.928
These protections are just one
part of a landmark reform that

00:02:32.928 --> 00:02:35.561
will finally reduce the
cost of health care.

00:02:35.561 --> 00:02:38.728
When it becomes law, families
will save on their premiums.

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.194
Small businesses and Americans
who don't get any insurance

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:44.828
today through their employers
will no longer be forced to pay

00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:47.528
punishingly high
rates to get coverage.

00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.027
This legislation will also
strengthen Medicare and extend

00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:53.328
the life of the program, while
saving senior citizens hundreds

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:56.161
of dollars a year in
prescription costs.

00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:58.561
And reforms to target
waste, inefficiency,

00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.094
and price-gouging by the
insurance industry will help

00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:06.761
make this the largest deficit
reduction plan in over a decade.

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.795
The insurance industry
knows all this.

00:03:08.795 --> 00:03:11.494
That's why they're at it again,
using their muscle in Washington

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:15.094
to try to block a vote that
they know they will lose.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:16.027
They're lobbying.

00:03:16.027 --> 00:03:17.194
They're running ads.

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.795
They're spending millions of
dollars to kill health insurance

00:03:19.795 --> 00:03:23.594
reform, just like they've
done so many times before.

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:25.494
They want to preserve a system
that works better for the

00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:29.494
insurance industry than it
does for the American people.

00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:33.027
But now -- for the first time -- there is a clear majority in the

00:03:33.027 --> 00:03:36.261
Senate that's willing to stand up to the insurance lobby and

00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:41.261
embrace lasting health insurance reforms that have eluded us for generations.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:43.428
The question is whether the
minority that opposes these

00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:46.561
reforms will continue to use
parliamentary maneuvers to try

00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:49.494
and stop the Senate
from voting on them.

00:03:49.494 --> 00:03:51.928
Whatever their position on
health insurance reform,

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:55.261
Senators ought to allow
an up or down vote.

00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:58.294
Let's bring this long and
vigorous debate to an end.

00:03:58.294 --> 00:04:01.194
Let's deliver on the promise of
health insurance reforms that

00:04:01.194 --> 00:04:04.328
will make our people healthier,
our economy stronger,

00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:06.628
and our future more secure.

00:04:06.628 --> 00:04:08.928
And as this difficult
year comes to a close,

00:04:08.928 --> 00:04:12.094
let's show the American people
that we are equal to the task of

00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:14.494
meeting our great challenges.

00:04:14.494 --> 00:04:17.528
Thanks for listening, and on
behalf of Michelle, Malia,

00:04:17.528 --> 00:04:22.094
Sasha, and Bo, happy holidays,
from our family to yours.
