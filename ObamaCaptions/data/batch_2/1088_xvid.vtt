00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:07.567
The President:
When I took office
eight months ago,

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.767
our nation was in the midst of
an economic crisis unlike any

00:00:10.767 --> 00:00:12.834
we'd seen in generations.

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:15.266
While I was confident that
our economy would recover,

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.066
we knew that employment is often
the last thing to come back

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.066
after a recession.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:25.400
Our task is to do everything we
possibly can to accelerate that process.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.600
And we've certainly made
progress on this front since the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.867
period last winter when we were losing an average of 700,000

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:32.500
jobs each month.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
But yesterday's report on
September job losses was a

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.066
sobering reminder that progress
comes in fits and starts,

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:43.333
and that we will need to grind
out this recovery step by step.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.033
That's why I'm working closely
with my economic team to explore

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.600
additional options to
promote job creation.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.133
And I won't let up until those
who seek jobs can find them;

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.233
until businesses that seek
capital and credit can thrive;

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:59.667
and until all responsible
homeowners can stay in their homes.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:01.133
It won't be easy.

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.700
It will require us to lay a new
foundation for our economy --

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.200
one that gives our workers the
skills and education they need

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.300
to compete; that invests in
renewable energy and the jobs of

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.333
the future; and that makes
health care affordable for

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.900
families and businesses -- particularly small businesses,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.400
many of which have been overwhelmed by rising health care costs.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.367
This is something I hear about
from entrepreneurs I meet --

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.834
people who've got a good
idea, and the expertise and

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:30.166
determination to build it
into a thriving business.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.900
But many can't take that leap
because they can't afford to

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.834
lose the health insurance they
have at their current job.

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:39.000
I hear about it from small
business owners who want to grow

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.100
their companies and hire
more people, but they can't,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.834
because they can barely afford
to insure the employees they have.

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.066
One small business owner wrote
to me that health care costs are

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:52.500
-- and I quote -- "stifling
my business growth."

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.667
He said that the money he
wanted to use for research and

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.467
development, and to
expand his operations,

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:00.834
has instead been "thrown
into the pockets of healthcare

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.133
insurance carriers."

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:05.600
These small businesses are
the mom and pop stores and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.667
restaurants, beauty shops and
construction companies that

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.166
support families and
sustain communities.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.467
They're the small
startups with big ideas,

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:17.100
hoping to be the next
Google, or Apple, or HP.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.834
Altogether, they create
roughly half of all new jobs.

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:24.934
And right now, they are paying
up to 18% more for the very same

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:28.033
insurance plans as larger
businesses because they have

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.500
higher administrative costs
and less bargaining power.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.633
Many have been forced to cut
benefits or drop coverage.

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.867
Some have shed jobs or
shut their doors entirely.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:40.767
And recent studies show
that if we fail to act now,

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:45.300
employers will pay 6% more to
insure their employees next year

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.433
-- and more than twice as
much over the next decade.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:51.033
Rising health care costs are
undermining our businesses,

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:54.300
exploding our deficits, and
costing our nation more jobs

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.367
with each passing month.

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:59.667
So we know that reforming our
health insurance system will be

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:02.533
a critical step in rebuilding
our economy so that our

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:05.567
entrepreneurs can pursue
the American Dream again,

00:03:05.567 --> 00:03:08.300
and our small businesses can
grow and expand and create new

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.700
jobs again.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.333
That's precisely what the reform legislation before Congress

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.333
right now will do.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.734
Under these proposals, small
businesses will be able to

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:20.834
purchase health insurance
through an insurance exchange,

00:03:20.834 --> 00:03:23.367
a marketplace where they
can compare the price,

00:03:23.367 --> 00:03:27.100
quality and services of
a wide variety of plans,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.200
many of which will provide
better coverage at lower cost

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.533
than the plans they have now.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.467
95% of small businesses won't
be required to cover their

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:39.200
employees, but many that do will
receive a tax credit to help

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.533
them pay for it.

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:43.266
If a small business chooses
not to provide coverage,

00:03:43.266 --> 00:03:46.300
its employees will receive tax
credits to help them purchase

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.000
health insurance on their own
through the insurance exchange.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.066
And no matter how you
get your insurance,

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.600
insurance companies will no
longer be allowed to deny your

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.133
coverage because of a
pre-existing condition.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:59.433
They won't be able to drop your
coverage if you get too sick,

00:03:59.433 --> 00:04:02.100
or lose your job,
or change jobs.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.600
And we'll limit the amount your
insurance company can force you

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.667
to pay out of your own pocket.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:11.633
By now, the urgency of these
reforms is abundantly clear.

00:04:11.633 --> 00:04:14.033
And after long hours of
thoughtful deliberation and

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:17.066
tough negotiation, the
Senate Finance Committee --

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:19.433
the final congressional
committee involved in shaping

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:23.567
health care legislation -- has finished the process of crafting

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.633
their reform proposal.

00:04:25.633 --> 00:04:28.000
As we move forward
in the coming weeks,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.500
I understand that members of
Congress from both parties will

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.533
want to engage in a vigorous
debate and contribute their own ideas.

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:36.567
And I welcome those
contributions.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:40.333
I welcome any sincere attempts
to improve legislation before it

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.000
reaches my desk.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.700
But what I will not accept
are attempts to stall,

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.333
or drag our feet.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:50.533
I will not accept partisan
efforts to block reform at any cost.

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:53.233
Instead, I expect us to move
forward with a spirit of

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:56.333
civility, a
seriousness of purpose,

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:59.200
and a willingness to compromise
that characterizes our

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.066
democratic process
at its very best.

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:05.300
If we do that, I'm confident that we will pass reform this

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.300
year, and help ensure that our
entrepreneurs, our businesses,

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.367
and our economy can
thrive in the years ahead.

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:13.433
Thanks.
