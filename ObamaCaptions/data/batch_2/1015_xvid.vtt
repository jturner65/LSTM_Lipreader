00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:09.734
The President:
This Memorial Day weekend,
Americans will gather on lawns

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:14.300
and porches, fire up the grill,
and enjoy the company of family,

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.500
friends, and neighbors.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.266
But this is not only a
time for celebration,

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:23.033
it's also a time to reflect on
what this holiday is all about;

00:00:23.033 --> 00:00:25.533
to pay tribute to
our fallen heroes;

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:28.467
and to remember the servicemen
and women who cannot be with us

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:32.266
this year because they are
standing post far from home --

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:36.000
in Iraq, Afghanistan,
and around the world.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.934
On Friday, I traveled
to Annapolis,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:39.734
where I spoke at the
Commencement of the United

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.600
States Naval Academy.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.867
It was an honor to address some
of America's newest sailors and

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.567
Marines as their
Commander-in-Chief.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.600
Looking out at all of
those young men and women,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.767
I was reminded of the
extraordinary service that they

00:00:52.767 --> 00:00:54.834
are rendering to our country.

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.400
And I was reminded, too, of
all the sacrifices that their

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.767
parents, siblings, and loved
ones make each day on their

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.834
behalf and on our behalf.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.333
Our fighting men and women -- and the military families who

00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.800
love them -- embody
what's best in America.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.767
And we have a responsibility to
serve all of them as well as

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:14.767
they have served us.

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:17.667
And yet, all too often in
recent years and decades, we,

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.066
as a nation, have failed to
live up to that responsibility.

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.433
We've failed to give them the
support they need or pay them

00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:25.767
the respect they deserve.

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:29.266
That's a betrayal of the sacred
trust that America has with all

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:34.133
who wear -- and all who have
worn -- the proud uniform of our country.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.400
And that is a sacred trust
I am committed to keeping as

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.600
President of the United States.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.467
That's why I will send our
servicemen and women into harm's

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:44.700
way only when it's necessary,
and ensure that they have the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.300
training and equipment they need
when they enter the theater of war.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.667
That's why we're building a
21st century Department of

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.633
Veterans Affairs with the
largest single-year funding

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.967
increase in three decades.

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.400
It's a commitment that will help
us provide our veterans with the

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.166
support and benefits
they have earned,

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:07.033
and expand quality health care
to a half million more veterans.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:09.433
That's why, this week, I signed
a bill that will eliminate some

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:13.233
of the waste and inefficiency in
our defense projects -- reform

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.033
that will better
protect our nation,

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.433
better protect our troops, and
save taxpayers tens of billions

00:02:18.433 --> 00:02:20.066
of dollars.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.066
And that's why we're laying a
new foundation for our economy

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:26.800
so that when our troops return
home and take off the uniform,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.834
they can find a good job,
provide for their families,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:33.767
and earn a college degree on
a Post-9/11 GI Bill that will

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:37.233
offer them the same opportunity
to live out their dreams that

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.834
was afforded our
greatest generation.

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.800
These are some of the
ways we can, must,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.967
and will honor the service of
our troops and the sacrifices of

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.567
their families.

00:02:46.567 --> 00:02:49.066
But we must also do our
part, not only as a nation,

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:51.967
but as individuals for those
Americans who are bearing the

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:55.200
burden of wars being
fought on our behalf.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400
That can mean sending a letter
or a care package to our troops overseas.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.300
It can mean volunteering at a
clinic where a wounded warrior

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.800
is being treated or bringing
supplies to a homeless veterans center.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.333
Or it can mean something as
simple as saying "thank you" to

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.934
a veteran you pass
on the street.

00:03:11.934 --> 00:03:14.200
That's what Memorial
Day is all about.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.633
It's about doing all we can to
repay the debt we owe to those

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:20.867
men and women who have answered
our nation's call by fighting

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.500
under its flag.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.867
It's about recognizing
that we, as a people,

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.834
did not get here by accident
or good fortune alone.

00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:31.467
It's about remembering
the hard winter of 1776,

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.700
when our fragile American
experiment seemed doomed to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.333
fail; and the early battles of
1861 when a union victory was

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:42.300
anything but certain;
and the summer of 1944,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.400
when the fate of a world rested
on a perilous landing unlike any

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.300
ever attempted.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.834
It's about remembering each and
every one of those moments when

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.500
our survival as a nation came
down not simply to the wisdom of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.066
our leaders or the
resilience of our people,

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.834
but to the courage and valor
of our fighting men and women.

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:04.734
For it's only by remembering
these moments that we can truly

00:04:04.734 --> 00:04:08.166
appreciate a simple lesson of
American life -- that what makes

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:13.533
all we are and all we aspire to
be possible are the sacrifices

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.166
of an unbroken line of Americans
that stretches back to our

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:19.133
nation's founding.

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.600
That's the meaning
of this holiday.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.800
That's a truth at the
heart of our history.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.233
And that is a lesson I hope all
Americans will carry with them

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:30.600
this Memorial Day
weekend and beyond.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.767
Thank you.
