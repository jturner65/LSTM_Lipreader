00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.433
The President:
As the Winter Olympics draw
to a close this weekend,

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:11.133
I just want to take a minute to
congratulate all the athletes

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:13.233
who competed in these games.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.700
And I especially want to say
how proud I am of all that the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.367
American men and women have achieved over the last few weeks.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.533
Whether it was the men's hockey
team's stunning upset of the

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:25.000
Canadians on their way
to the gold-medal game,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.066
or Lindsey Vonn's heroic gold-medal comeback from a shin

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.633
injury, or Apolo Ohno becoming the most decorated American

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:35.834
winter Olympian of all time, you can't help but be inspired by

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:40.633
the sheer grit and athletic prowess on display in Vancouver.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.800
And it's not just the medal
count that's inspiring --

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.934
though we've certainly
done great on that score.

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:50.266
What's truly inspiring is the
character of the men and women

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.367
who have won those medals.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.266
The sacrifices they've made.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.300
The integrity they've shown.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.266
The indomitable Olympic spirit
that says no matter who you are

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.700
or where you come from or what
difficulties you may face,

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.467
you can work hard and train hard
and still triumph in the end.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:10.166
That's why we watch.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:11.834
That's why we cheer.

00:01:11.834 --> 00:01:14.467
That's why in the middle of an
extremely challenging time for

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:18.600
America, we've been able to come
together as one nation for a few

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.467
weeks in February and swell with
pride at what our citizens have achieved.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.033
Now, when it comes to meeting
the larger challenges we face as

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.533
a nation, I realize that finding
this unity is easier said than

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:32.233
done -- especially
in Washington.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:35.233
But if we want to compete on the
world stage as well as we've

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:39.800
competed in the world's games,
we need to find common ground.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
We need to move past the
bickering and the game-playing

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.667
that holds us back and blocks
progress for the American people.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.734
I know it's possible to do this.

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.767
And we were reminded of that
last week when Democrats and

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.467
Republicans in the Senate came
together to pass a jobs bill

00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:59.400
that will give small businesses
tax credits to hire more workers.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.300
We also saw it when Democrats
and Republicans in the House

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.900
came together to pass a bill
that would force insurance

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.100
companies to abide by
common-sense rules that prevent

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.633
price-fixing and the other practices that drive up health care costs.

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.767
We need that same spirit of
cooperation and bipartisanship

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:18.633
when it comes to finally passing
reform that will bring down the

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.834
cost of health care and give
Americans more control over

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:23.734
their insurance.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:27.166
On Thursday, we brought both
parties together for a frank and

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.633
productive discussion
about this issue.

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:32.633
In that discussion, we heard
many areas of agreement.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:35.467
Both sides agreed that the
rising cost of health care is a

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.533
serious problem that plagues
families, small businesses,

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.800
and our federal budget.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.900
Many on both sides agreed that
we should give small businesses

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.800
and individuals the ability to
participate in a new insurance

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.266
marketplace -- which members
of Congress would also use --

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:54.400
that would allow them to pool
their purchasing power and get a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.333
better deal from
insurance companies.

00:02:57.333 --> 00:02:59.500
And I heard some ideas from
our Republican friends that I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.900
believe are very worthy
of consideration.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.433
But still, there
were differences.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.433
We disagreed over whether
insurance companies should be

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:12.633
held accountable when they deny
people care or arbitrarily raise premiums.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:14.300
I believe they should.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.934
We disagreed over giving tax
credits to small businesses and

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:20.200
individuals that would make
health care affordable for those

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.633
who don't have it.

00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:25.200
This would be the largest middle
class tax cut for health care in

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.300
history, and I believe
we should do it.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.333
And while we agreed that
Americans with pre-existing

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.800
conditions should be
able to get coverage,

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.200
we disagreed on how to do that.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.333
Some of these disagreements
we may be able to resolve.

00:03:38.333 --> 00:03:40.000
Some we may not.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.233
And no final bill will include
everything that everyone wants.

00:03:43.233 --> 00:03:45.066
That's what compromise is.

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.834
I said at the end of Thursday's
summit that I'm eager and

00:03:47.834 --> 00:03:50.266
willing to move forward with
members of both parties on

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:53.734
health care if the other side is
serious about coming together to

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.567
resolve our differences
and get this done.

00:03:56.567 --> 00:03:59.233
But I also believe that we can't lose the opportunity to meet

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:00.967
this challenge.

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:03.433
The tens of millions of men and
women who can't afford their

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:07.233
health insurance -- they can't wait another generation for us to act.

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:09.166
Small businesses can't wait.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.300
Americans with pre-existing
conditions can't wait.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.700
State and federal budgets can't
sustain these rising costs.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.633
It's time for us
to come together.

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.333
It's time for us to act.

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:22.834
It's time for those of us in
Washington to live up to our

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:27.100
responsibilities to the
American people and to future generations.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.800
So let's get this done.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.133
And thanks for listening.
