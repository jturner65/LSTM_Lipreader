00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.928
Mr. President:
I speak to you today
during a time that is holy

00:00:11.928 --> 00:00:15.227
and filled with meaning for
believers around the world.

00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:18.361
Earlier this week, Jewish people
gathered with family and friends

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:23.328
to recite the stories of their
ancestors' struggles and ultimate liberation.

00:00:23.328 --> 00:00:26.261
Tomorrow, Christians of all
denominations will come together

00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:31.227
to rejoice and remember the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:35.261
These are two very different
holidays with their own very different traditions.

00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:39.027
But it seems fitting that we
mark them both during the same week.

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:43.428
For in a larger sense, they are
both moments of reflection and renewal.

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:45.695
They are both occasions to
think more deeply about the

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:49.127
obligations we have to ourselves
and the obligations we have to

00:00:49.127 --> 00:00:52.861
one another, no matter who we
are, where we come from, or what

00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:54.895
faith we practice.

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:58.127
This idea - that we are all
bound up, as Martin Luther King

00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:02.127
once said, in "a single garment
of destiny"- is a lesson of all

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:04.428
the world's great religions.

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:07.528
And never has it been more
important for us to reaffirm

00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:11.194
that lesson than it is today -
at a time when we face tests and

00:01:11.194 --> 00:01:14.828
trials unlike any we
have seen in our time.

00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:18.161
An economic crisis that
recognizes no borders.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.528
Violent extremism that has
claimed the lives of innocent

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:24.494
men, women, and children
from Manhattan to Mumbai.

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:27.695
An unsustainable dependence on
foreign oil and other sources of

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:31.361
energy that pollute our air and
water and threaten our planet.

00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:34.494
The proliferation of the world's
most dangerous weapons, the

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:39.361
persistence of deadly disease,
and the recurrence of age-old conflicts.

00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:41.795
These are challenges that no
single nation, no matter how

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.594
powerful, can confront alone.

00:01:44.594 --> 00:01:46.695
The United States
must lead the way.

00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:49.394
But our best chance to solve
these unprecedented problems

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:52.361
comes from acting in
concert with other nations.

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.594
That is why I met with leaders
of the G-20 nations to ensure

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:58.795
that the world's largest
economies take strong and

00:01:58.795 --> 00:02:02.361
unified action in the face of
the global economic crisis.

00:02:02.361 --> 00:02:06.027
Together, we have taken steps to
stimulate growth, restore the

00:02:06.027 --> 00:02:10.061
flow of credit, open markets,
and dramatically reform our

00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:13.361
financial regulatory systems
to prevent such crises from

00:02:13.361 --> 00:02:18.194
occurring again - steps that
will lead to job creation at home.

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:21.227
It is only by working together
that we will finally defeat 21st

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:23.961
century security
threats like al Qaeda.

00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:27.461
So it was heartening that our
NATO allies united in Strasbourg

00:02:27.461 --> 00:02:30.795
behind our strategy in
Afghanistan and Pakistan, and

00:02:30.795 --> 00:02:34.594
contributed important resources
to support our effort there.

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:38.127
It is only by coordinating with
countries around the world that

00:02:38.127 --> 00:02:40.961
we will stop the spread of the
world's most dangerous weapons.

00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:43.494
That is why I laid out a
strategy in Prague for us to

00:02:43.494 --> 00:02:45.895
work with Russia and
other nations to stop the

00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:49.194
proliferation of nuclear
weapons; to secure nuclear

00:02:49.194 --> 00:02:52.461
materials from terrorists; and,
ultimately, to free the world

00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:55.461
from the menace of
a nuclear nightmare.

00:02:55.461 --> 00:02:59.194
And it is only by building a new
foundation of mutual trust that

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:02.594
we will tackle some of our
most entrenched problems.

00:03:02.594 --> 00:03:05.994
That is why, in Turkey, I spoke
to members of Parliament and

00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:09.561
university students about rising
above the barriers of race,

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:12.994
region, and religion
that too often divide us.

00:03:12.994 --> 00:03:17.561
With all that is at stake today,
we cannot afford to talk past one another.

00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:19.961
We can't afford to allow old
differences to prevent us from

00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.294
making progress in
areas of common concern.

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:26.895
We can't afford to let
walls of mistrust stand.

00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:30.895
Instead, we have to find - and
build on - our mutual interests.

00:03:30.895 --> 00:03:33.461
For it is only when people
come together, and seek common

00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:37.461
ground, that some of that
mistrust can begin to fade.

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.561
And that is where
progress begins.

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:43.628
Make no mistake: we live in a
dangerous world, and we must be

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:46.928
strong and vigilant in
the face of these threats.

00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:49.761
But let us not allow whatever
differences we have with other

00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:53.494
nations to stop us from coming
together around those solutions

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:57.561
that are essential to our
survival and success.

00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:00.928
As we celebrate Passover,
Easter, and this time of

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:05.561
renewal, let's find strength in
our shared resolve and purpose

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:07.828
in our common aspirations.

00:04:07.828 --> 00:04:10.994
And if we can do that, then not
only will we fulfill the sacred

00:04:10.994 --> 00:04:14.661
meaning of these holy days, but
we will fulfill the promise of

00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:17.761
our country as a leader
around the world.
