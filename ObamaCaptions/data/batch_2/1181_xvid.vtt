00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:10.861
The President:
I'm speaking to you from
just outside Portland,

00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:15.328
Oregon where I'm visiting Intel,
a company that helped pioneer

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:16.994
the digital age.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.994
I just came from a tour
of an assembly line where

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:22.628
highly-skilled technicians are
building microprocessors that

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:26.895
run everything from desktop
computers to smartphones.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:30.961
But these workers aren't just
manufacturing high-tech computer chips.

00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:34.661
They're showing us how
America will win the future.

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:39.461
For decades, Intel has led the world
in developing new technologies.

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:42.227
But even as global
competition has intensified,

00:00:42.227 --> 00:00:47.094
this company has invested, built,
and hired right here in America.

00:00:47.094 --> 00:00:51.127
Three-quarters of Intel's products
are made by American workers.

00:00:51.127 --> 00:00:53.994
And as the company expands
operations in Oregon and builds

00:00:53.994 --> 00:01:00.728
a new plant in Arizona, it plans to
hire another 4,000 people this year.

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:03.528
Companies like Intel are
proving that we can compete --

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:05.795
that instead of just being a
nation that buys what's made

00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:10.994
overseas, we can make things in America
and sell them around the globe.

00:01:10.994 --> 00:01:13.928
Winning this competition depends
on the ingenuity and creativity

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:18.761
of our private sector -- which
was on display in my visit today.

00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:22.094
But it's also going to depend on
what we do as a nation to make

00:01:22.094 --> 00:01:25.594
America the best place
on earth to do business.

00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:29.294
Over the next ten years, nearly
half of all new jobs will

00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:32.161
require education
beyond high school,

00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:35.394
many requiring proficiency
in math and science.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.861
And yet today we've fallen
behind in math, and in science,

00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.861
and in graduation rates.

00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.628
As a result, companies like
Intel struggle to hire American

00:01:43.628 --> 00:01:47.361
workers with the skills
that fit their needs.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:50.561
If we want to win the global
competition for new jobs and

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:54.127
industries, we've got to win the
global competition to educate

00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:55.528
our people.

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:57.161
We've got to have
the best trained,

00:01:57.161 --> 00:01:59.994
best skilled workforce
in the world.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:03.361
That's how we'll ensure that the
next Intel, the next Google,

00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:06.561
or the next Microsoft
is created in America,

00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:08.961
and hires American workers.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:11.027
This is why, over
the past two years,

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:14.528
my administration has made
education a top priority.

00:02:14.528 --> 00:02:17.361
We've launched a competition
called "Race to the Top" --

00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.294
a reform that's lifting
academic standards and getting

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:23.761
results; not because Washington
dictated the answers,

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.394
but because states and local
schools pursued innovative solutions.

00:02:28.394 --> 00:02:30.628
We're also making college more
affordable for millions of

00:02:30.628 --> 00:02:33.795
students, and revitalizing
our community colleges,

00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:36.161
so that folks can get the
training they need for the

00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:37.828
careers they want.

00:02:37.828 --> 00:02:40.594
And as part of this effort,
we've launched a nationwide

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:44.227
initiative to connect graduates
that need jobs with businesses

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:46.094
that need their skills.

00:02:46.094 --> 00:02:49.594
Intel understands how important
these partnerships can be --

00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:53.361
recognizing that their company's
success depends on a pipeline of

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.928
skilled people ready to fill
high-wage, high-tech jobs.

00:02:56.928 --> 00:03:00.428
Intel often pays for workers
to continue their education at

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:02.895
nearby Portland
State University.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:06.761
As a result, one out of every
fifteen of Intel's Oregon

00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:10.294
employees has a degree
from Portland State.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:12.761
In fact, Intel's commitment to
education begins at an even

00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.328
younger age.

00:03:14.328 --> 00:03:17.594
The company is providing
training to help 100,000 math

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:20.861
and science teachers improve
their skills in the classroom.

00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.594
And today, I'm also meeting a
few students from Oregon who

00:03:23.594 --> 00:03:26.628
impressed the judges in the high
school science and engineering

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:30.961
competitions that Intel
sponsors across America.

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:35.227
One young woman, Laurie Rumker,
conducted a chemistry experiment

00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:38.895
to investigate ways to protect
our water from pollution.

00:03:38.895 --> 00:03:41.094
Another student,
named Yushi Wang,

00:03:41.094 --> 00:03:43.928
applied the principles of
quantum physics to design a

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:45.861
faster computer chip.

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.161
We're talking about
high school students.

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.561
So these have been a tough
few years for our country.

00:03:50.561 --> 00:03:54.361
And in tough times, it's natural
to question what the future holds.

00:03:54.361 --> 00:03:57.795
But when you meet young
people like Laurie and Yushi,

00:03:57.795 --> 00:03:59.828
it's hard not to be inspired.

00:03:59.828 --> 00:04:03.728
And it's impossible not to
be confident about America.

00:04:03.728 --> 00:04:06.361
We're poised to lead
in this new century --

00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:08.561
and not just because of the good
work that large companies like

00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.161
Intel are doing.

00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:13.127
Across America, there are
innovators and entrepreneurs who

00:04:13.127 --> 00:04:15.828
are trying to start
the next Intel,

00:04:15.828 --> 00:04:18.928
or just get a small business
of their own off the ground.

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.261
I'll be meeting with some of
these men and women next week in

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:24.227
Cleveland, to get ideas about
what we can do to help their

00:04:24.227 --> 00:04:27.328
companies grow and create jobs.

00:04:27.328 --> 00:04:31.127
The truth is, we have everything
we need to compete: bold

00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:37.494
entrepreneurs, bright new ideas, and
world-class colleges and universities.

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:40.528
Most of all, we have young
people just brimming with

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:43.061
promise and ready
to help us succeed.

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:45.294
All we have to do is
tap that potential.

00:04:45.294 --> 00:04:48.795
That's the lesson on
display here at Intel.

00:04:48.795 --> 00:04:51.361
And it's how America
will win the future.

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.761
Thanks so much.
