00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:09.000
The President:
A year ago, when I took office in the midst of the worst

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.033
recession since the
Great Depression,

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:12.867
I promised you two things.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:15.734
The first was that there
would be better days ahead.

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:18.633
And the second was that the
road to recovery would be long,

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.367
and sometimes bumpy.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:22.567
That was brought
home again yesterday.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.934
We learned that in November, our
economy saw its first month of

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:30.066
job gains in nearly two years -- but last month, we lost more

00:00:30.066 --> 00:00:31.467
than we gained.

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.734
Now, we know that no
single month makes a trend,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:37.934
and job losses for the final
quarter of 2009 were one-tenth

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:40.433
of what they were in
the first quarter.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:44.600
But until we see a trend of
good, sustainable job creation,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.767
we will be relentless in our
efforts to put America back to work.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.567
That task goes even deeper than
replacing the seven million jobs

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.000
that have been lost
over the past two years.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.533
We need to rebuild our economy
in such a way that our families

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.166
can feel a measure
of security again.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:01.033
Too many of the folks I've
talked with this year,

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.000
and whose stories I read
in letters at night,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.233
tell me that they've known their
own private recessions since

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.600
long before economists
declared one --

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.066
and they still feel the
recession long after economists

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:13.934
have declared it over.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.734
And that's because, for decades,
Washington avoided doing what

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:20.200
was right in favor of
doing what was easy.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.033
And the result was an economy
where some made out well,

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.934
but the middle class too
often took a beating.

00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:29.066
Over the past decade, the
income of the average household

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:33.433
actually declined, and we lost
as many jobs as we created.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:35.767
Hardworking folks who did
everything right suddenly found

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.100
themselves forced to downscale
their dreams because of economic

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.433
factors beyond their control.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.066
We're talking about
simple dreams.

00:01:43.066 --> 00:01:44.667
American dreams.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:46.467
A good job with a good wage.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.700
A secure and
dignified retirement.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.233
Stable health care so you don't
go broke just because you get sick.

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:56.000
The chance to give our kids
a better shot than we got.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.700
And that's why, as we begin
to emerge from this crisis,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.066
we will not return to that
complacency that helped cause

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.333
the crisis.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.934
Even as we focus on putting
America back to work,

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.500
we're building a new foundation
for our economy to create the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.467
good, lasting jobs and shared
prosperity of tomorrow.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:15.000
We're making historic
investments in science and in a

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.166
clean energy economy that will
generate and keep the jobs and

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:21.233
industries of the future
right here in America.

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.033
We're reforming our
education system,

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:25.734
so that our kids are fully
prepared to compete with workers

00:02:25.734 --> 00:02:30.166
anywhere in the world and win
the race for the 21st century.

00:02:30.166 --> 00:02:32.567
We're fixing our broken health
insurance system that's crushing

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:35.467
families, eating away at
workers' take-home pay,

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:39.834
and nailing small businesses
with double-digit premium increases.

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.233
And that's what I'd like
to focus on for a moment.

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.333
After a long and
thorough debate,

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:48.066
we are on the verge of passing
health insurance reform that

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:51.500
will finally offer Americans the
security of knowing they'll have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.367
quality, affordable health care
whether they lose their job,

00:02:55.367 --> 00:02:59.000
change their jobs,
move, or get sick.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.500
The worst practices the insurance industry will be

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.934
forever banned.

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:06.900
And costs will finally come
down for families, businesses,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.867
and our government.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.567
Now, it'll take a few years to
fully implement these reforms in

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:13.333
a responsible way.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.533
But what every American should
know is that once I sign health

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:20.100
insurance reform into law, there
are dozens of protections and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.834
benefits that will
take effect this year.

00:03:23.834 --> 00:03:26.133
Uninsured Americans with
a pre-existing illness or

00:03:26.133 --> 00:03:30.300
condition will finally be able
to purchase coverage they can afford.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.100
Children with pre-existing
conditions will no longer be

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.233
refused coverage, and young
adults will be able to stay on

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:40.500
their parents' policy until
they're 26 or 27 years old.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.834
Small business owners who can't
afford to cover their employees

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:47.266
will be immediately offered tax
credits to purchase coverage.

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:50.533
Early retirees who receive
coverage from their employers

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:54.600
will see their coverage
protected and their premiums go down.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.100
Seniors who fall into the
coverage gap known as the donut

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.667
hole will receive discounts of
up to 50% on their prescriptions

00:04:01.667 --> 00:04:04.667
as we begin to close
that gap altogether.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:07.900
And every patient's choice
of doctor will be protected,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.500
along with access
to emergency care.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.834
Here's what else will happen
within the first year.

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:16.133
Insurance plans will be required
to offer free preventive care to

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:19.200
their customers -- so that we can start catching preventable

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.200
illnesses and diseases
on the front end.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.900
They'll no longer be allowed to
impose restrictive annual limits

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.700
on the amount of coverage you
receive or lifetime limits on

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.900
the amount of
benefits you receive.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.934
They'll be prohibited from
dropping your coverage when you

00:04:31.934 --> 00:04:33.734
get sick and need it most.

00:04:33.734 --> 00:04:36.433
And there will be a new,
independent appeals process for

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:40.333
anyone who feels they were
unfairly denied a claim by their

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:42.266
insurance company.

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:45.800
In short, once I sign health
insurance reform into law,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.867
doctors and patients will have
more control over their health

00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:53.433
care decisions, and insurance
company bureaucrats will have less.

00:04:53.433 --> 00:04:55.867
All told, these changes
represent the most sweeping

00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:58.500
reforms and toughest
restrictions on insurance

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.834
companies that this
country has ever known.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:06.000
That's how we'll make 2010 a
healthier and more secure year

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.633
for every American -- for those who have health insurance, and

00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:11.834
those who don't.

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:14.934
And we enter a new decade,
now, with new perils --

00:05:14.934 --> 00:05:16.967
but we're going to meet them.

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:19.000
It's also a time of
tremendous promise --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.533
and we're going to seize it.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.600
We will rebuild the American
Dream for our middle class and

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.433
put the American economy on a
stronger footing for the future.

00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:30.900
And this year, I am as hopeful
and as confident as ever that

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.767
we're going to rise to this
moment the same way that

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:37.533
generations of Americans
always have: as one nation,

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:39.133
and one people.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:40.500
Thanks for listening.
