00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.033
The President:
In recent days, we've seen
turmoil and tragedy around the

00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.700
world, from change in the Middle
East and North Africa to the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.533
earthquake and tsunami in Japan.

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:17.266
As I said on Friday, we will
work with our partners in the

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.533
region to protect innocent
civilians in Libya and hold the

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.600
Gaddafi regime accountable.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.133
And we will continue to stand
with the people of Japan in

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.767
their greatest hour of need.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:31.000
As we respond to these
immediate crises abroad,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.033
we also will not let up in our
effort to tackle the pressing,

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.867
ongoing challenges
facing our country,

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.000
including accelerating
economic growth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.400
That's why, over the weekend,
I'll be in Latin America.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.266
One of the main reasons for my
trip is to strengthen economic

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:50.467
partnerships abroad so that we
create good jobs here at home.

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.633
Latin America is a part of the
world where the economy is

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.433
growing very quickly.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:58.467
And as these markets grow, so does
their demand for goods and services.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:02.400
The question is, where are those
goods and services going to come from?

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.500
As President, I want to make sure
these products are made in America.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.467
I want to open more markets
around the world so that

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:13.467
American companies can do more
business and hire more of our people.

00:01:13.467 --> 00:01:16.734
Here's a statistic to explain
why this is important.

00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:21.133
Every $1 billion of goods and
services we export supports more

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:24.900
than 5,000 jobs in
the United States.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.834
So, the more we sell overseas, the
more jobs we create on our shores.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:32.600
That's why, last year, I set a
goal for this country: to double

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
our exports by 2014.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.400
And it's a goal we're
on track to meet.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.066
Part of the reason why is the
rapid growth of Latin America,

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:43.700
and their openness
to American business.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.500
We now export more than three
times as much to Latin America

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.667
as we do to China, and our
exports to the region will soon

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:54.266
support more than two million
jobs here in the United States.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.567
Brazil, the first stop on
our trip, is a great example.

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:00.834
In 2010, America's exports
to Brazil supported more than

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:03.934
250,000 American jobs.

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.233
These are jobs at places like
Capstone Turbine in California,

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:10.567
which recently sold $2 million
worth of high-tech energy

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.567
equipment to Brazil.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:14.467
Another company
is Rhino Assembly,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.500
a small business in Charlotte,
North Carolina that sells and

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.200
repairs tools for
building cars and planes.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.233
A deal with a distributor in
Brazil has resulted in new sales

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.834
and new employees at that firm.

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:29.266
And we can point to large
companies like Sikorsky,

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:32.667
whose helicopter sales to
Brazil help sustain a large,

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:35.333
skilled workforce in
Connecticut, Alabama,

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.200
and Pennsylvania.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.967
Today, Brazil imports more goods
from the United States than from

00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.667
any other nation.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.333
And I'll be meeting with
business leaders from both

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:46.800
countries to talk about how we
can create even more jobs by

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.433
deepening these economic ties.

00:02:49.433 --> 00:02:52.066
After Brazil, I will
also visit Chile,

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:53.834
a country with a
growing economy,

00:02:53.834 --> 00:02:57.000
and increasing demand
for American goods.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.567
In fact, since 2004, our
exports there are up 300%,

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:06.367
and now support about 70,000
jobs here in the United States.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.200
Finally, we'll head
to El Salvador,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.967
a nation with so much promise
for growth with the potential to

00:03:10.967 --> 00:03:13.500
benefit both of our nations.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.834
We've always had a special bond
with our neighbors to the south.

00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.767
It's a bond born of
shared history and values,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.467
and strengthened by the millions
of Americans who proudly trace

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:25.000
their roots to Latin America.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.033
But what is clear is that in
an increasingly global economy,

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:32.033
our partnership with these
nations is only going to become

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.734
more vital.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:36.433
For it's a source of
growth and prosperity --

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.300
and not just for the
people of Latin America,

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.100
but for the American
people as well.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.233
Thanks.
