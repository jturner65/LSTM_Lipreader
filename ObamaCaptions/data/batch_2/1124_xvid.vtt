00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:07.367
The President:
Even though our economy
is growing again,

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.767
these are still tough
times for America.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.233
Too many businesses
are still shuttered.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:15.000
Too many families
can't make ends meet.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.533
And while yesterday, we learned
that the unemployment rate has

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:21.400
dropped below 10% for the
first time since summer,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.433
it's still unacceptably high -- and too many Americans still

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.300
can't find work.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.800
But what we have to remember at a time like this is that we're

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.700
not helpless in the face
of our difficulties.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.100
As Americans, we
make our own destiny.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.967
We forge our own path.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.767
And I'm confident that if we
come together and put aside the

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.734
politics that keeps holding
us back, we can do that again.

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:45.934
We can rebuild this
economy on a new,

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:50.867
stronger foundation that
leads to more jobs and greater prosperity.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:53.800
I believe a key part of that
foundation is America's small

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.233
businesses -- the places
where most new jobs begin.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.533
These companies represent the
essence of the American spirit

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.100
-- the promise that anyone can succeed in this country if you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.133
have a good idea and the
determination to see it through.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:10.734
And every once in awhile, these
ideas don't just lead to a new

00:01:10.734 --> 00:01:14.533
business and new jobs, but a new
American product that forever

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.233
changes the world.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.967
After all, Hewlett
Packard began in a garage.

00:01:18.967 --> 00:01:22.100
Google began as a
simple research project.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.500
Government can't create
these businesses,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.567
but it can give entrepreneurs
the support they need to open

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.967
their doors, expand,
or hire more workers.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.500
And that's what we've
always done in this country.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.834
The folks at Southwest
Windpower in Flagstaff,

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:39.000
Arizona started their
company in a small home.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.867
Since getting a loan from the
Small Business Administration,

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.834
they've sold 160,000 wind
turbines to about 90 different

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:49.367
countries, and are hiring
even more workers today.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.633
When Sam Ko walked into one
of the SBA's small business

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.533
development centers in Illinois,
he didn't have any business

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:58.400
experience at all -- just
a patent for a new metal

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.734
manufacturing technology.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.934
He was given a loan
and a business plan,

00:02:02.934 --> 00:02:05.500
and today his company
is still growing,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.266
with offices all
over the Midwest.

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:12.600
Last year, the steps we took supported over 47,000 loans to

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.800
small businesses and delivered billions in tax relief to small

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.600
business owners, which helped companies keep their doors open,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.166
make payroll, and hire workers.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.600
But we can and must do more.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.500
That's why I've proposed a
series of steps this week to

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.900
support small business owners
and the jobs they create --

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.400
to provide more access to
credit, more incentives to hire,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.133
and more opportunities to grow
and sell products all over the world.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.600
Because financing remains
difficult for good,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.100
credit-worthy small
businesses across the country,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.633
I've proposed that we take
$30 billion from the TARP fund

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:51.100
originally used for Wall Street
and create a new Small Business

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.000
Lending Fund that will provide
capital for community banks on Main Street.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.633
These are the small, local banks
that will be able to give our

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:02.367
small business owners more of
the credit they need to stay afloat.

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.800
And we should also continue to
waive fees, increase guarantees,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.033
and expand the size of
SBA-backed loans for small businesses.

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.967
And yesterday, I proposed making
it easier for small business

00:03:12.967 --> 00:03:16.700
owners to refinance their
mortgages during these tough times.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.867
To give these companies greater
incentives to grow and create

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:22.333
jobs, I've proposed a new tax
credit for more than one million

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:26.333
small businesses that hire
new workers or raise wages,

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:29.767
as well as the elimination of
all capital gains taxes on small

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.734
business investment.

00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:34.800
Finally, we should provide
targeted support to the most

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.700
innovative small businesses
-- the ones with the greatest

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.700
potential to export new goods and products all over the world.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.367
A lot of these companies -- like the wind turbine manufacturer I

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:47.266
mentioned -- are the foundation on which we can rebuild our

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:50.133
economy to compete
in the 21st century.

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.166
They just need a little help
securing the financing they need

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.700
to get off the ground.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.066
We have every incentive
to help them do that.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.533
Next week, Congress will
start debating many of these proposals.

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:03.834
And if anyone has additional
ideas to support small

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.734
businesses and create jobs,
I'm happy to consider them.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.533
My door's always open.

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:12.367
But I urge members of both
parties: do not oppose good

00:04:12.367 --> 00:04:16.166
ideas just because it's
good politics to do so.

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:19.600
The proposals I've outlined are
not Democratic or Republican;

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.367
liberal or conservative.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:23.767
They are pro-business,
they are pro-growth,

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:25.667
and they are pro-job.

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:29.500
Leaders in both parties have
supported similar ideas in the past.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.200
So let's come together and pass
these measures without delay.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.333
Let's put more
Americans back to work,

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:37.800
and let's give our small
business owners the support to

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.533
do what they've always done: the
freedom to pursue their dreams

00:04:41.533 --> 00:04:44.033
and build our country's future.

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:45.200
Thanks for listening.
