00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.400
The President:
This week, I asked Congress to schedule a final vote on reform

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.834
that will give families and
businesses more control over

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:15.867
their health care by holding
insurance companies more accountable.

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:18.066
This comes after nearly
a year of debate,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.800
as well as a seven hour summit
with Democrats and Republicans

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.533
where we had a public and
substantive discussion on health care.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.633
Since then, I've said that I'm
willing to incorporate some

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.900
ideas offered by Republicans,
and we're eliminating special

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
provisions that had no
place in health care reform.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.900
Now, despite all the progress
and improvements we've made,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.900
Republicans in Congress insist
that the only acceptable course

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.700
on health care is to start over.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.967
But you know what?

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.266
The insurance companies
aren't starting over.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.867
I just met with some of them on
Thursday and they couldn't give

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:53.233
me a straight answer as to
why they keep arbitrarily and

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:58.467
massively raising premiums -- by as much as 60% in states like Illinois.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:01.600
If we don't act, they
will continue to do this.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.333
They'll continue to drop people's coverage when they need it.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:08.400
They'll continue to refuse
coverage based on pre-existing conditions.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.834
These practices will continue.

00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:13.133
And that's why we
have to act now.

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:15.033
That's why the United States
Congress owes the American

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:19.266
people an up-or-down vote
on health insurance reform.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.934
The proposal we've put forward
would end the worst practices of

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:25.734
the insurance industry, lower
costs for millions of Americans,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:28.533
and give uninsured individuals
and small businesses the same

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.200
kind of choice of private health
insurance that Members of

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.400
Congress get for themselves.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.500
And while it will take a few
years to fully implement these

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.767
reforms, there are numerous
protections and benefits that

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:41.800
would start to take
effect this year.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.166
This year, small business owners
will receive tax credits to

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.233
purchase health insurance.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:49.633
This year, thousands of
uninsured Americans with

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:53.467
pre-existing conditions will
finally be able to purchase coverage.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:56.100
Insurance companies will no
longer be allowed to deny

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.266
coverage to children with
pre-existing conditions.

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:04.266
And they'll no longer be allowed to drop your coverage when you get sick.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:07.600
This year, all new insurance
plans will be required to offer

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.967
free preventive care
to their customers --

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:12.066
so that we can start catching
preventable illnesses and

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.367
diseases on the front end.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:17.133
There'll no longer be lifetime
limits or restrictive annual

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.567
limits on the amount
of care you receive.

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.133
Young adults will be able to
stay on their parents' insurance

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:25.200
policy until they're
26 years old.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.900
And there will be a new,
independent appeals process for

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.400
anyone who feels they were
unfairly denied a claim by their

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.533
insurance company.

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:37.000
Finally, seniors who fall into
the gap in coverage known as the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.934
donut hole will receive $250
to help them pay for their prescriptions.

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.967
What won't change when this bill
is signed this: if you like the

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:50.033
insurance plan you have
now, you can keep it.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:52.900
If you like your doctor,
you can keep your doctor.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.433
Because nothing should get in
the way of the relationship

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:58.433
between a family
and their doctor.

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.633
If we act now, all of this
will happen this year.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:03.700
Millions of lives will improve.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.433
Some will be saved.

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:08.000
Many families and small business
owners will have health

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.233
insurance for the very
first time in their lives.

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.967
Doctors and patients will have
more control over their health

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:18.834
care decisions, and insurance
company bureaucrats will have less.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:21.100
This future is within our grasp.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.800
But we also know what the future
will look like if we don't act

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.533
-- if we let this opportunity pass for another year,

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.633
or another decade, or
another generation.

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:33.133
More Americans will lose their
family's health insurance if

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.467
they switch jobs
or lose their job.

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:38.066
More small businesses will be
forced to choose between health

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:39.867
care and hiring.

00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:43.433
More insurance companies
will raise premiums and deny coverage.

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:46.400
And the rising cost of Medicare
and Medicaid will sink our

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.700
government deeper
and deeper into debt.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.700
I don't accept that future for
the United States of America.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.633
I know it's been a long
and hard road to this point.

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:58.066
And we're not finished
with our journey just yet.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:59.734
But we are close.

00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:01.200
Very close.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.767
So I ask Congress
to finish its work.

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:07.333
I ask them to give the American
people an up or down vote.

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:09.400
Let's show our citizens
that it's still possible for

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.200
Washington to look out for
the people's interests and the

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.800
people's future.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.166
Thanks for listening.
