00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.166
The President:
There were many causes of the turmoil that ripped through our

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.567
economy over the past two years.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.700
But above all, this crisis
was caused by the failures in

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.700
the financial industry.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.834
What's clear is that this
crisis could have been avoided

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.633
if Wall Street firms
were more accountable,

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.100
if financial dealings
were more transparent,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.266
and if consumers and
shareholders were given more

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.600
information and authority
to make decisions.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.233
But that didn't happen.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.233
And that's because special
interests have waged a

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:36.200
relentless campaign
to thwart even basic,

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.900
common-sense rules -- rules
to prevent abuse and protect consumers.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.266
In fact, the financial industry
and its powerful lobby have

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.200
opposed modest safeguards
against the kinds of reckless

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.800
risks and bad practices that
led to this very crisis.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.533
The consequences of this
failure of responsibility --

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:56.600
from Wall Street
to Washington --

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.333
are all around us:
8 million jobs lost,

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:04.000
trillions in savings erased,
countless dreams diminished or denied.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.667
I believe we have to do
everything we can to ensure that

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:09.567
no crisis like this
ever happens again.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.867
And that's why I'm fighting
so hard to pass a set of Wall

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:15.300
Street reforms and
consumer protections.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.200
A plan for reform is currently
moving through Congress.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.934
Here's what this plan would do.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:22.567
First, it would enact the
strongest consumer financial

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.400
protections ever.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.066
It would put consumers back in
the driver's seat by forcing big

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:30.233
banks and credit card
companies to provide clear,

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:32.867
understandable information
so that Americans can make

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:36.467
financial decisions
that work best for them.

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:41.166
Next, these reforms would bring
new transparency to financial dealings.

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:44.867
Part of what led to this crisis
was firms like AIG and others

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:48.500
making huge and risky bets -- using things like derivatives --

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.467
without accountability.

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:52.934
Warren Buffett himself once
described derivatives bought and

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:57.633
sold with little oversight as
"financial weapons of mass destruction."

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:01.166
That's why through reform we'd
help ensure that these kind of

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:04.166
complicated financial
transactions take place on an

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:05.734
open market.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:09.100
Because, ultimately, it is a
marketplace that is open, free,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.300
and fair that will allow
our economy to flourish.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.433
We'd also close loopholes to stop the kind of recklessness

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:17.834
and irresponsibility
that we've seen.

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:20.633
It's these loopholes that
allowed executives to take risks

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.667
that not only endangered
their companies,

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.934
but also our entire economy.

00:02:24.934 --> 00:02:27.567
And we're going to put in place
new rules so that big banks and

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:31.166
financial institutions will pay
for the bad decisions they make

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:32.767
-- not taxpayers.

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:36.400
Simply put, this means no
more taxpayer bailouts.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.367
Never again will taxpayers be
on the hook because a financial

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:42.333
company is deemed
"too big to fail."

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:45.600
Finally, these reforms hold Wall
Street accountable by giving

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.633
shareholders new power
in the financial system.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:51.667
They'll get a say on pay: a vote
on the salaries and bonuses

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.667
awarded to top executives.

00:02:53.667 --> 00:02:56.800
And the SEC will ensure that
shareholders have more power in

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.967
corporate elections, so that
investors and pension holders

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.467
have a stronger voice in
determining what happens with

00:03:02.467 --> 00:03:04.600
their life savings.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.967
Now, unsurprisingly, these
reforms have not exactly been

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:11.066
welcomed by the people who
profit from the status quo --

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.266
as well their allies
in Washington.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.734
This is probably why the special
interests have spent a lot of

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:20.633
time and a lot of money lobbying to kill or weaken the bill.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:23.934
Just the other day, in fact, the
Leader of the Senate Republicans

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:27.033
and the Chair of the Republican
Senate campaign committee met

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:30.900
with two dozen top Wall Street
executives to talk about how to

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.533
block progress on this issue.

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:36.133
Lo and behold, when he
returned to Washington,

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:38.367
the Senate Republican
Leader came out against

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:40.934
common-sense reforms
that we've proposed.

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:43.700
In doing so, he made the cynical
and deceptive assertion that

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.500
reform would somehow
enable future bailouts --

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.700
when he knows that it would
do exactly the opposite.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.000
Every day we don't act, the same
system that led to bailouts

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.734
remains in place -- with the exact same loopholes and the

00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:58.667
exact same liabilities.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:01.333
And if we don't change
what led to the crisis,

00:04:01.333 --> 00:04:03.900
we will doom ourselves
to repeat it.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.266
That's the truth.

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:07.867
Opposing reform will leave
taxpayers on the hook if a

00:04:07.867 --> 00:04:10.533
crisis like this
ever happens again.

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:14.300
So my hope is that we can put
this kind of politics aside.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.433
My hope is that Democrats and
Republicans can find common

00:04:17.433 --> 00:04:19.734
ground and move
forward together.

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:24.033
But this is certain: one way or
another, we will move forward.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:25.967
This issue is too important.

00:04:25.967 --> 00:04:28.667
The costs of inaction
are too great.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.800
We will hold Wall
Street accountable.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.767
We will protect and empower
consumers in our financial system.

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:37.367
That's what reform is all about.

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:38.800
That's what we're fighting for.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.900
And that's exactly what
we're going to achieve.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.367
Thanks so much.
