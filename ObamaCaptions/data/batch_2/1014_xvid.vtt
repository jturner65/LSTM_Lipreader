00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.166
The President:
Good morning.

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.633
Over the past few months, as
we have put in place a plan to

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:14.133
speed our economic recovery, I've spoken repeatedly of the

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:17.633
need to lay a new foundation
for lasting prosperity;

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.066
a foundation that will support
good jobs and rising incomes;

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.100
a foundation for economic growth
where we no longer rely on

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.533
excessive debt and
reckless risk -

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.133
but instead rely on skilled workers and sound investments to

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:33.967
lead the world in the
industries of the 21st century.

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.500
Two pillars of this new
foundation are clean energy

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.734
and health care.

00:00:37.734 --> 00:00:40.300
And while there remains a great
deal of difficult work ahead,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.133
I'm heartened by what we've
seen these past few days:

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.867
a willingness of those with
different points of view and

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:49.500
disparate interests to come
together around common goals -

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.967
to embrace a shared sense
of responsibility and make

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.166
historic progress.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.333
Chairman Henry Waxman and
members of the Energy and

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.967
Commerce Committee brought
together stakeholders from all

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:03.567
corners of the country - and
every sector of our economy -

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:06.133
to reach a historic
agreement on comprehensive

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.834
energy legislation.

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:10.066
It's another promising
sign of progress,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:12.567
as longtime opponents
are sitting together,

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.834
at the same table, to help
solve one of America's most

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:17.667
serious challenges.

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:20.600
For the first time, utility
companies and corporate leaders

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.700
are joining, rather
than opposing,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.900
environmental advocates and labor leaders to create a new

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.967
system of clean energy initiatives that will help

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:32.767
unleash a new era of
growth and prosperity.

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.100
It's a plan that will finally
reduce our dangerous dependence

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.533
on foreign oil and cap the
carbon pollution that threatens

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.800
our health and our climate.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.633
Most important, it's a plan that
will trigger the creation of

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:45.800
millions of new
jobs for Americans,

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.200
who will produce the wind
turbines and solar panels and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.400
develop the alternative
fuels to power the future.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.800
Because this we know: the nation
that leads in 21st century clean

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.066
energy is the nation that
will lead the 21st century

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:01.667
global economy.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:04.567
America can and
must be that nation -

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:07.800
and this agreement is a
major step toward this goal.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.166
But we know that our
families, our economy,

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.734
and our nation itself will not
succeed in the 21st century if

00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:16.867
we continue to be held down by
the weight of rapidly rising

00:02:16.867 --> 00:02:20.166
health care costs and a
broken health care system.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:22.533
That's why I met with
representatives of insurance and

00:02:22.533 --> 00:02:25.300
drug companies,
doctors and hospitals,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.266
and labor unions who are
pledging to do their part to

00:02:28.266 --> 00:02:30.467
reduce health care costs.

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.033
These are some of the groups who've been among the fiercest

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:36.567
critics of past comprehensive
health care reform plans.

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:40.734
But today they too are
recognizing that we must act.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.066
Our businesses will
not be able to compete;

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.934
our families will not be
able to save or spend;

00:02:45.934 --> 00:02:49.500
our budgets will remain
unsustainable unless we get

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.033
health care costs under control.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:54.800
These groups have pledged to do
their part to reduce the annual

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.500
health care spending growth
rate by 1.5 percentage points.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.433
Coupled with
comprehensive reform,

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:05.300
their efforts could help to save
our nation more than $2 trillion

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.500
in the next ten years - and
save hardworking families $2,500

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.266
each in those coming years.

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.033
This week, I also invited
Speaker of the House

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:18.500
Nancy Pelosi, Majority
Leader Steny Hoyer, and other

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.667
congressional leaders to
the White House to discuss

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.166
comprehensive health
reform legislation.

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:26.100
The House is working to pass
a bill by the end of July -

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.800
before they head out
for their August recess.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.266
That's the kind of urgency and
determination we need to achieve

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:35.633
comprehensive reform by
the end of this year.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:38.000
And the reductions in spending
the health care community has

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.567
pledged will help make
this reform possible.

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.400
I've always believed that it
is better to talk than not to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.066
talk; that it's far more
productive to reach over a

00:03:47.066 --> 00:03:50.533
divide than to shake
your fists across it.

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.834
This has been an alien notion
in Washington for far too long,

00:03:53.834 --> 00:03:55.900
but we're seeing that
the ways of Washington are

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.834
beginning to change.

00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:00.700
For the calling of this moment
is too loud and too urgent

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.967
to ignore.

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:04.800
Our success as a nation - the
future of our children and

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.834
grandchildren - depend upon our
willingness to cast aside old

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:12.066
arguments, overcome
stubborn divisions,

00:04:12.066 --> 00:04:16.500
and march forward as one
people and one nation.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.834
This is how progress
has always been made.

00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:21.567
This is how a new
foundation will be built.

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:24.100
We cannot assume that
interests will always align,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.033
or that fragile
partnerships will not fray.

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:28.367
There will be setbacks.

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.967
There will be difficult days.

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:31.500
But we're off to a good start.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.834
And I'm confident that we will - in the weeks, months, and years

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:37.967
ahead - build on what we've already achieved and lay this

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:41.166
foundation which will not only bring about prosperity for this

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:44.567
generation, but for
generations to come.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:45.667
Thanks so much.
