00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:08.133
The President:
Every month since January,
when I became your President,

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:10.433
I've spoken to you about the
periodic reports of the Labor

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.867
Department on the number of
jobs created or lost during the

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.133
previous month; numbers that
tell a story about how America's

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.934
economy is faring overall.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:23.767
In those first months, the
numbers were nothing short of devastating.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.367
The worst recession since the
1930s had wrecked havoc on the

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.500
lives of so many of
our fellow Americans.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.934
Yesterday, the numbers released
by the Labor Department

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:38.100
reflected a continuing positive
trend of diminishing job loss.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.734
But for those who were laid off
last month and the millions of

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:44.133
Americans who have lost
their jobs in this recession,

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.633
a good trend isn't good enough.

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:48.367
Trends don't buy groceries.

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:51.300
Trends don't pay the rent
or a college tuition.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.300
Trends don't fulfill the
needs within each of us to be

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.867
productive, to provide
for our families,

00:00:56.867 --> 00:01:00.300
to make the most of our lives,
to reach for our dreams.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.066
So, it's true that
we, as a country,

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:06.100
are in a very different place
than we were when 2009 began.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.433
Because of the Recovery Act and
a number of other steps we've

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:11.333
taken, we're no longer facing
the potential collapse of our

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:14.934
financial system or a
second Great Depression.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:18.600
We're no longer losing jobs
at a rate of 700,000 a month.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.667
And our economy's growing
for the first time in a year.

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.266
But too many of our neighbors
are still out of work because

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:29.467
the growth we've seen hasn't yet
translated into all the jobs we need.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:32.667
Stung by this brutal recession,
businesses that have kept their

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:36.767
doors open are still wary
about adding workers.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.000
Instead of hiring, many are
simply asking their employees to

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.133
work more hours, or they're
adding temporary help.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.600
History tells us this is usually
what happens with recessions --

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.100
even as the economy grows, it
takes time for jobs to follow.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.100
But the folks who have been
looking for work without any

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.734
luck for months and,
in some cases, years,

00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.700
can't wait any longer.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.266
For them, I am determined to do
everything I can to accelerate

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:03.834
our progress so we're
actually adding jobs again.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.400
That's why, this week, I invited
a group of business owners from

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.700
all across the country to
the White House to talk about

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.633
additional steps we can take
to help jumpstart hiring.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:16.066
We brought together unions and
universities to talk about what

00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.467
we can do to support our workers
today and prepare our students

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.600
to outcompete workers
around the world tomorrow.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.967
We brought together mayors and
community leaders to talk about

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:28.967
how we can open up new
opportunities in our cities and towns.

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:32.367
On Friday, I spent the day
in Allentown, Pennsylvania,

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:35.233
and met with workers and
small business owners there.

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.300
I stopped by a steel company
called Allentown Metal Works,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.734
and spoke at Lehigh
Community College.

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.066
I visited folks at a
job placement center,

00:02:43.066 --> 00:02:45.734
and stopped by a
shift change at Alpo.

00:02:45.734 --> 00:02:48.967
The stories and concerns I heard
mirrored the countless letters I

00:02:48.967 --> 00:02:51.133
receive every single day.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.533
And they speak louder than any
statistic or government report.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:57.633
The folks in Allentown -- and in
all the Allentowns across our

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.967
country -- are the
most dedicated,

00:02:59.967 --> 00:03:02.333
productive workers in the world.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:06.133
All they're asking for is
a chance, and a fair shake.

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.633
And that's exactly what
I'm working to give them.

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.567
In the coming days, I'll be unveiling additional ideas aimed

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.834
at accelerating job growth and
hiring as we emerge from this

00:03:14.834 --> 00:03:16.900
economic storm.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.700
And so that we don't face
another crisis like this again,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.266
I am determined to meet our
responsibility to do what we

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:25.934
know will strengthen our
economy in the long-run.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:28.233
That's why I'm not going to let
up in my efforts to reform our

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.400
health care system; to give our
children the best education in

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.934
the world; to promote the
jobs of tomorrow and energy

00:03:34.934 --> 00:03:38.467
independence by investing
in a clean energy economy;

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:41.533
and to deal with the
mounting federal debt.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.600
From the moment I was
sworn into office,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.800
we have taken a number of
difficult steps to end this

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.734
economic crisis.

00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:51.000
We didn't take them because
they were popular or gratifying.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.367
They weren't.

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.300
We took these steps because
they were necessary.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.567
I didn't run for President
to pass emergency recovery

00:03:57.567 --> 00:04:02.333
programs, or to bail out the banks or to shore up auto companies.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.133
I didn't run for President
simply to manage the crisis of

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:09.400
the moment, while kicking our
most pressing problems down the road.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.300
I ran for President to help
hardworking families succeed and

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.233
to stand up for the
embattled middle class.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:19.100
I ran to fight for a country
where responsibility is still

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.000
rewarded, and hard-working
people can get ahead.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.233
I ran to keep faith with the
sacred American principle that

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:31.633
we will deliver to our children
a future of even greater possibility.

00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:34.333
And my commitment to
you, the American people,

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.033
is that I will focus every
single day on how we can get

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:40.734
people back to work, and how
we can build an economy that

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:43.967
continues to make real
the promise of America for

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:45.834
generations to come.
