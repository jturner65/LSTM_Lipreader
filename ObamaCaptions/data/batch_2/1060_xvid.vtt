00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:09.100
The President:
Lost in the news of last week was a headline that ought to be

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.967
a source of concern
for every American.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:16.667
It said, "Many Nations
Passing U.S. in Education."

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.300
Now, debates in Washington tend
to be consumed with the politics

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.266
of the moment: who's
up in the daily polls;

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.633
whose party stands
to gain in November.

00:00:24.633 --> 00:00:28.166
But what matters to you --
what matters to our country --

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:30.133
is not what happens
in the next election,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:32.834
but what we do to lift
up the next generation.

00:00:32.834 --> 00:00:36.367
And the fact is, there are few
issues that speak more directly

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:39.400
to our long term success as a
nation than issues concerning

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.133
the education we
provide to our children.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.567
Our prosperity in the 20th
century was fueled by an

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.467
education system that helped
grow the middle class and

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.734
unleash the talents of our
people more fully and widely

00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:52.967
than at any time in our history.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:56.367
We built schools and focused
on the teaching of math and science.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:58.400
We helped a generation of
veterans go to college through

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.900
the GI Bill.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.700
We led the globe in
producing college graduates,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.967
and in turn we led in producing
ground-breaking technologies and

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:09.033
scientific discoveries that
lifted living standards and set

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:13.000
us apart as the world's
engine of innovation.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.300
Of course, other
nations recognize this,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
and are looking to gain an edge
in the global marketplace by

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.066
investing in better schools,
and supporting teachers,

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.400
and committing to clear
standards that will produce

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.633
graduates with more skills.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.033
Our competitors understand that
the nation that out-educates us

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.600
today will out-compete
us tomorrow.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.967
Yet, too often we've failed to
make inroads in reforming and

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:37.867
strengthening our public
education system --

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:40.867
the debate mired in worn
arguments hurled across

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:42.500
entrenched divides.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.100
As a result, over the last few
decades, we've lost ground.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.567
One assessment shows American
fifteen year olds no longer even

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.433
near the top in math and science
when compared to their peers

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:54.000
around the world.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.100
As referenced in the
news report I mentioned,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
we've now fallen behind most
wealthy countries in our high

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.166
school graduation rates.

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.533
And while we once led the world
in the proportion of college

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.767
graduates we produced,
today we no longer do.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:10.600
Not only does that risk our
leadership as a nation,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.066
it consigns millions of
Americans to a lesser future.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.567
For we know that the level of
education a person attains is

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:21.233
increasingly a prerequisite for
success and a predictor of the

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:24.900
income that person will earn
throughout his or her life.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.900
Beyond the economic statistics
is a less tangible but no less

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.533
painful reality: unless we take action -- unless we step up --

00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:35.500
there are countless children who
will never realize their full

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.233
talent and potential.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:39.233
I don't accept that
future for them.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:42.500
And I don't accept that future
for the United States of America.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.200
That's why we're engaged in a
historic effort to redeem and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.800
improve our public schools: to
raise the expectations for our

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.066
students and for ourselves, to
recognize and reward excellence,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:55.667
to improve performance
in troubled schools,

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:58.400
and to give our kids and our
country the best chance to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.133
succeed in a changing world.

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:04.367
Under the leadership of an
outstanding Education Secretary,

00:03:04.367 --> 00:03:07.600
Arne Duncan, we launched
a Race to the Top,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.633
through which states compete for
funding by committing to reform

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:14.000
and raising standards, by
rewarding good teaching,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.367
by supporting the development of
better assessments to measure

00:03:16.367 --> 00:03:19.767
results, and by emphasizing math
and science to help prepare

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.834
children for
college and careers.

00:03:22.834 --> 00:03:25.633
And on Monday, my administration
will send to Congress our

00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:28.633
blueprint for an updated
Elementary and Secondary

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:32.533
Education Act to overhaul
No Child Left Behind.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.133
What this plan recognizes
is that while the federal

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:38.367
government can play a leading
role in encouraging the reforms

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:41.767
and high standards we need, the
impetus for that change will

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:45.500
come from states, and from local
schools and school districts.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.266
So, yes, we set a high bar -- but we also provide educators

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.767
the flexibility to reach it.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:54.667
Under these guidelines, schools
that achieve excellence or show

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:57.967
real progress will be rewarded,
and local districts will be

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:00.934
encouraged to commit to change
in schools that are clearly

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:03.100
letting their students down.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.500
For the majority of schools
that fall in between --

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.834
schools that do well
but could do better --

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:10.500
we will encourage continuous
improvement to help keep our

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.533
young people on track for a
bright future: prepared for the

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:15.633
jobs of the 21st century.

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:18.934
And because the most important
factor in a child's success is

00:04:18.934 --> 00:04:21.500
the person standing at the
front of the classroom,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.133
we will better prepare
teachers, support teachers,

00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:27.166
and encourage teachers
to stay in the field.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.700
In short, we'll treat the
people who educate our sons and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.800
daughters like the
professionals they are.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.000
Through this plan we are setting
an ambitious goal: all students

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.600
should graduate from high school
prepared for college and a

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.433
career -- no matter who you
are or where you come from.

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.300
Achieving this goal
will be difficult.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.433
It'll take time.

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:47.233
And it will require
the skills, talents,

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:51.033
and dedication of many:
principals, teachers, parents,

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:52.367
and students.

00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:55.934
But this effort is essential
for our children and for our country.

00:04:55.934 --> 00:04:58.400
And while there will always be
those cynics who claim it can't

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.433
be done, at our best, we know
that America has always risen to

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:04.734
the challenges that we've faced.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:06.600
This challenge is no different.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.233
As a nation, we are engaged
in many important endeavors:

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:13.433
improving the economy, reforming
the health care system,

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:16.533
encouraging innovation in energy
and other growth industries of

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:20.934
the 21st century -- all while still in the midst of two wars.

00:05:20.934 --> 00:05:22.734
But our success in
these efforts --

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:25.600
and our success in the
future as a people --

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.367
will ultimately depend on
what happens long before an

00:05:28.367 --> 00:05:32.266
entrepreneur opens his doors,
or a nurse walks the rounds,

00:05:32.266 --> 00:05:35.166
or a scientist steps
into her laboratory.

00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:37.467
Our future is determined
each and every day,

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:39.300
when our children
enter the classroom,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.433
ready to learn and
brimming with promise.

00:05:42.433 --> 00:05:45.500
It's that promise we
must help them fulfill.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.934
Thanks so much.
