00:00:05.991 --> 00:00:08.091
The President:
All across America,
people work hard to meet

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:09.792
their responsibilities.

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:14.024
You do your job, take care of
your family, pay your bills.

00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:17.024
Sometimes, particularly
in tough times like these,

00:00:17.024 --> 00:00:21.291
you have to make hard choices
about where to spend and where to save.

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:23.391
That's what being
responsible means.

00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.892
It's a bedrock value
of our country.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:30.124
And that ought to be a value
that our government lives up to as well.

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:34.158
Yet, over the past decade, this
hasn't always been the case.

00:00:34.158 --> 00:00:36.925
Ten years ago, we had a big
budget surplus with projected

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.391
surpluses far into the future.

00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:42.591
Ten years later, those
surpluses are gone.

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:44.991
In fact, when I first
walked through the door,

00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:49.458
the government's budget
deficit stood at $1.3 trillion,

00:00:49.458 --> 00:00:54.291
with the budget gap over the
next decade projected to be $8 trillion.

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.658
Now partly, the
recession's to blame.

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:58.325
With millions of
people out of work,

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.658
and millions of families
facing hardship,

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:03.525
folks are paying less in taxes
while seeking more services,

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:05.291
like unemployment benefits.

00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.792
Rising health care
costs are also to blame.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.991
Each year, more and more tax
dollars are devoted to Medicare

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.058
and Medicaid.

00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:16.191
But what also has made these large deficits possible was the

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:19.991
end of a common sense rule
called "pay as you go."

00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:21.191
It's pretty simple.

00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.124
It says to Congress, you
have to pay as you go.

00:01:24.124 --> 00:01:27.658
You can't spend a dollar unless
you cut a dollar elsewhere.

00:01:27.658 --> 00:01:31.825
This is how a responsible family
or business manages a budget.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:36.191
This is how a responsible government manages a budget, as well.

00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.525
It was this rule that helped
lead to balanced budgets in the

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:42.291
1990s, by making clear that we
could not increase entitlement

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:46.224
spending or cut taxes simply
by borrowing more money.

00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:48.358
And it was the abandonment
of this rule that allowed the

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:51.291
previous administration and
previous congresses to pass

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.658
massive tax cuts for the wealthy
and create an expensive new drug

00:01:54.658 --> 00:01:57.358
program without
paying for any of it.

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.625
Now in a perfect world, Congress
would not have needed a law to

00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.892
act responsibly, to remember
that every dollar spent would

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:07.925
come from taxpayers today
-- or our children tomorrow.

00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:09.558
But this isn't a perfect world.

00:02:09.558 --> 00:02:10.858
This is Washington.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:13.758
And while in theory there is
bipartisan agreement on moving

00:02:13.758 --> 00:02:16.958
forward on balanced
budgets, in practice,

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.158
this responsibility for the
future is often overwhelmed by

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:22.058
the politics of the moment.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.991
It falls prey to the pressures
of special interest groups,

00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.091
to the pull of local concerns,
and to a reality familiar to

00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.758
every single American -- the fact that it's a lot easier to

00:02:30.758 --> 00:02:32.591
spend a dollar than save one.

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:34.792
That's why this
rule is necessary.

00:02:34.792 --> 00:02:37.325
And that's why I'm pleased that Congress fulfilled my request to

00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:38.558
restore it.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:42.091
Last night, I signed the "pay
as you go" rule into law.

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.458
Now Congress will have
to pay for what it spends,

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:46.325
just like everybody else.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:48.091
But that's not all we must do.

00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:50.825
Even as we make critical
investments to create jobs today

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:52.858
and lay a foundation
for growth tomorrow --

00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:55.024
by cutting taxes for
small businesses,

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.591
or investing in education,
or promoting clean energy,

00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:00.991
and modernizing our
roads and railways --

00:03:00.991 --> 00:03:04.591
we have to continue to go
through the budget line by line,

00:03:04.591 --> 00:03:06.258
looking for ways to save.

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:09.625
We have to cut where we
can, to afford what we need.

00:03:09.625 --> 00:03:13.591
This year, I've proposed another
$20 billion in budget cuts.

00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:16.058
And I've also called for a
freeze in government spending

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:17.692
for three years.

00:03:17.692 --> 00:03:19.991
It won't affect benefits
through Medicare, Medicaid,

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.525
or Social Security.

00:03:21.525 --> 00:03:23.525
And it will not affect
national security --

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:25.325
including benefits for veterans.

00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:28.024
But it will affect the
rest of the budget.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:31.358
Finally, I've proposed a
bipartisan Fiscal Commission to

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:34.925
provide recommendations for
long-term deficit reduction.

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.558
Because in the end, solving
our fiscal challenge --

00:03:37.558 --> 00:03:40.692
so many years in the making -- will take both parties coming

00:03:40.692 --> 00:03:42.958
together, putting
politics aside,

00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:45.825
and making some hard choices about what we need to spend,

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:47.224
and what we don't.

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:49.725
It will not happen
any other way.

00:03:49.725 --> 00:03:53.158
Unfortunately this proposal -- which received the support of a

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:56.625
bipartisan majority in the Senate -- was recently blocked.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:04:00.291
So, I will be creating this
commission by executive order.

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:03.458
After a decade of profligacy,
the American people are tired of

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:06.591
politicians who talk the talk
but don't walk the walk when it

00:04:06.591 --> 00:04:08.825
comes to fiscal responsibility.

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:11.325
It's easy to get up in front
of the cameras and rant against

00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:12.892
exploding deficits.

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:16.191
What's hard is actually
getting deficits under control.

00:04:16.191 --> 00:04:18.258
But that's what we must do.

00:04:18.258 --> 00:04:20.024
Like families
across the country,

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:23.558
we have to take responsibility
for every dollar we spend.

00:04:23.558 --> 00:04:25.458
And with the return
of "pay as you go,"

00:04:25.458 --> 00:04:27.858
as well as other steps
we've begun to take,

00:04:27.858 --> 00:04:29.925
that is exactly
what we are doing.

00:04:29.925 --> 00:04:31.325
Thanks.
