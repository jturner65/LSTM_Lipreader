00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:08.600
The President:
This week, I joined leaders from around the world at the United

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.834
Nations and the G-20 economic
summit in Pittsburgh.

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:14.066
Today, I can report
on what we achieved --

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:16.700
a new commitment to
meet common challenges,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.033
and real progress in advancing
America's national security and

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.200
economic prosperity.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.567
As I said at the U.N., over
the past nine months my

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:27.233
administration has renewed
American leadership,

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.300
and pursued a new era of
engagement in which we call upon

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.900
all nations to live up to
their responsibilities.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.633
This week, our engagement
produced tangible results in

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.033
several areas.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:40.900
In Pittsburgh, the world's major
economies agreed to continue our

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.967
efforts to spur global demand
to put our people back to work.

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:47.467
We committed ourselves to
economic growth that is balanced

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:51.433
and sustained -- so we avoid
the booms and busts of the past.

00:00:51.433 --> 00:00:54.266
We reached an historic agreement
to reform the global financial

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:57.734
system -- to promote responsibility and prevent abuse

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.900
so that we never face a
crisis like this again.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.834
And we reformed our
international economic

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.934
architecture, so that we can
better coordinate our efforts to

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.800
meet the challenges
of the 21st century.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.600
We also established American
leadership in the global pursuit

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.734
of the clean energy
of the 21st century.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:18.600
I am proud that the G-20 nations
agreed to phase out $300 billion

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.133
worth of fossil fuel subsidies.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:23.166
This will increase
our energy security,

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.400
reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
combat the threat of climate

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.333
change, and help create the
new jobs and industries of the future.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.867
In New York, we advanced the
cause of peace and security.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.367
I joined the first meeting
between Israeli and Palestinian

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.500
leaders in nearly a year -- a meeting that even nine months

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.734
ago did not seem possible.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:45.834
And we resolved to move forward
in the journey towards a just,

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.867
lasting and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:51.533
We also took unprecedented
steps to secure loose nuclear

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:54.834
materials; to stop the
spread of nuclear weapons;

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.066
and to seek a
world without them.

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.967
As the first U.S. president
to ever chair a meeting of the

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:03.266
United Nations Security Council, I was proud that the Council

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:07.233
passed a historic and unanimous
resolution embracing the

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:11.300
comprehensive strategy I
outlined this year in Prague.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.433
To prevent nuclear weapons
from falling into the hands of

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.934
terrorists, the Security Council
endorsed our global effort to

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.467
lock down all vulnerable
material within four years.

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:23.567
We reaffirmed the basic compact
of the global nonproliferation

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:26.400
regime: all nations have the
right to peaceful nuclear

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.533
energy; nations with nuclear
weapons have the responsibility

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:33.800
to move toward disarmament; and
nations without them have the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.600
responsibility to forsake them.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.734
The United States is meeting our
responsibilities by pursuing an

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:44.066
agreement with Russia to reduce
our strategic warheads and launchers.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.667
And just as we meet
our responsibilities,

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.900
so must other nations,
including Iran and North Korea.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.800
Earlier this year, we imposed tough new sanctions on North

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.066
Korea to stop their efforts
to develop weapons of mass destruction.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:01.033
And we will continue to stand
with our allies and partners to

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:04.000
press North Korea to
move in a new direction.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.934
This week, we joined with the
United Kingdom and France in

00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:09.667
presenting evidence that Iran
has been building a secret

00:03:09.667 --> 00:03:12.333
nuclear facility
to enrich uranium.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.867
This is a serious challenge
to the global nonproliferation

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:19.333
regime, and continues a
disturbing pattern of Iranian evasion.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.166
That's why international
negotiations with Iran scheduled

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:26.400
for October 1st now
take on added urgency.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.000
My offer of a serious,
meaningful dialogue to resolve

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.100
this issue remains open.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.934
But Iran must now cooperate
fully with the International

00:03:33.934 --> 00:03:38.033
Atomic Energy Agency, and
take action to demonstrate its

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:39.934
peaceful intentions.

00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:42.433
On this, the international
community is more united than

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.000
ever before.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.266
Yesterday, I stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with our

00:03:46.266 --> 00:03:49.700
European allies in
condemning Iran's program.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.667
In our meetings and
public statements,

00:03:51.667 --> 00:03:54.867
President Medvedev of Russia and
I agreed that Iran must pursue a

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.700
new course or face consequences.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.333
All of the permanent members
of the United Nations Security

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.867
Council, and Germany, have made
it clear that Iran must fulfill

00:04:03.867 --> 00:04:06.100
its responsibilities.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.834
Iran's leaders must now choose
-- they can live up to their

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:11.600
responsibilities and achieve
integration with the community

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.800
of nations.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.100
Or they will face increased
pressure and isolation,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.900
and deny opportunity
to their own people.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.033
These are the urgent
threats of our time.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.633
And the United States is
committed to a new chapter of

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:26.533
international
cooperation to meet them.

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:30.200
This new chapter will not be
written in one week or even one year.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.867
But we have begun.

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:34.367
And for the American people
and the people of the world,

00:04:34.367 --> 00:04:38.033
it will mean greater security
and prosperity for years to come.
