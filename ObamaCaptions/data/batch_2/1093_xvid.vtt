00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:08.700
The President:
This is a week of
faithful celebration.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.867
On Monday and Tuesday nights,
Jewish families and friends in

00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.133
the United States and around the
world gathered for a Seder to

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.467
commemorate the Exodus from
Egypt and the triumph of hope

00:00:18.467 --> 00:00:22.333
and perseverance over
injustice and oppression.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.900
On Sunday, my family will join
other Christians all over the

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.600
world in marking the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.967
And while we worship
in different ways,

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.600
we also remember the shared
spirit of humanity that inhabits

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.633
us all -- Jews and
Christians, Muslims and Hindus,

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.600
believers and
nonbelievers alike.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.200
Amid the storm of public debate,
with our 24/7 news cycle,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.800
in a town like Washington that's
consumed with the day-to-day,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.333
it can sometimes be easy to
lose sight of the eternal.

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:55.433
So, on this Easter weekend,
let us hold fast to those

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:59.867
aspirations we hold in common
as brothers and sisters,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:03.500
as members of the same
family -- the family of man.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.233
All of us know how
important work is --

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.667
not just for the paycheck, but
for the peace of mind that comes

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.500
from knowing you can
provide for your family.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.300
As Americans, and
as human beings,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.533
we seek not only the security,
but the sense of dignity,

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.667
the sense of community,
that work confers.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.734
That's why it was heartening
news that last month,

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:23.633
for the first time in
more than two years,

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:26.300
our economy created a
substantial number of jobs,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.967
instead of losing them.

00:01:27.967 --> 00:01:30.667
We've begun to reverse
the devastating slide,

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:33.367
but we have a long way to go
to repair the damage from this

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:36.467
recession, and that will
continue to be my focus every

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.467
single day.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:42.467
All of us also value our health and the health of our loved ones.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.066
All of us have experienced
an illness, a loss,

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:47.033
or a personal tragedy.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.834
All of us know that no matter
what we're doing or what else is

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.734
going on in our lives, if the
health of someone we love is

00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:55.266
endangered, nothing
else matters.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:58.333
Our health is the rock upon
which our lives are built,

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.734
for better and for worse.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.767
All of us value education.

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.400
We know that in an economy
as competitive as ours,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.467
an education is a
prerequisite for success.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:09.867
But we also know
that ultimately,

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:12.900
education is about something
more, something greater.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.200
It's about the ability that
lies within each of us to rise

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.700
above any barrier, no matter
how high; to pursue any dream,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.600
no matter how big; to fulfill
our God-given potential.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.133
All of us are striving to
make a way in this world;

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.367
to build a purposeful and
fulfilling life in the fleeting

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.300
time we have here.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.867
A dignified life.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.433
A healthy life.

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.233
A life, true to its potential.

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:38.700
And a life that serves others.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.567
These are aspirations that
stretch back through the ages --

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:43.734
aspirations at the
heart of Judaism,

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:46.834
at the heart of Christianity, at
the heart of all of the world's

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.300
great religions.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.567
The rites of Passover, and
the traditions of Easter,

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.967
have been marked by people in
every corner of the planet for

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.834
thousands of years.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:58.834
They've been marked in times
of peace, in times of upheaval,

00:02:58.834 --> 00:03:01.100
and in times of war.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.834
One such war-time service was
held on the black sands of Iwo

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:06.834
Jima more than sixty years ago.

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:09.500
There, in the wake of some of
the fiercest fighting of World

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.567
War II, a chaplain rose to
deliver an Easter sermon,

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:17.266
consecrating the memory, he
said "of American dead --

00:03:17.266 --> 00:03:20.500
Catholic, Protestant, Jew.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.433
Together," he said, "they
huddled in foxholes or crouched

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:27.333
in the bloody sands...Together
they practiced virtue,

00:03:27.333 --> 00:03:32.033
patriotism, love of country,
love of you and of me."

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:35.700
The chaplain continued, "The
heritage they have left us,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.767
the vision of a new world, [was]
made possible by a common bond

00:03:39.767 --> 00:03:45.500
that united them...their only
hope that this unity will endure."

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.734
Their only hope that
this unity will endure.

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:52.133
On this weekend, as Easter
begins and Passover comes to a

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:57.133
close, let us remain ever
mindful of the unity of purpose,

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:01.100
the common bond, the
love of you and of me,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.767
for which they
sacrificed all they had;

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:06.934
and for which so many others
have sacrificed so much.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.834
Let us make its pursuit
-- and fulfillment --

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:14.333
our highest aspiration, as
individuals and as a nation.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.633
Happy Easter and Happy Passover
to all those celebrating,

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.233
here in America, and
around the world.
