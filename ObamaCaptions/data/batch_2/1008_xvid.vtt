00:00:06.767 --> 00:00:09.100
Even as we face
an economic crisis which demands

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.033
our constant focus, forces of
nature can also intervene in

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:16.500
ways that create other crises
to which we must respond - and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.066
respond urgently.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.100
For the people of North and
South Dakota and Minnesota who

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.367
live along rivers spilling over
their banks, this is one such

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:25.834
moment.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.700
Rivers and streams throughout
the region have flooded or are

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.433
at risk of flooding.

00:00:30.433 --> 00:00:32.867
The cities of Fargo and
neighboring Moorhead are

00:00:32.867 --> 00:00:36.367
vulnerable as the waters of
the Red River have risen.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:39.100
Thousands of homes and
businesses are threatened.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.000
That's why, on Tuesday, I
granted a major disaster

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.333
declaration request for the
State of North Dakota and

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.300
ordered federal support into the
region to help state and local

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.900
officials respond
to the flooding.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.066
This was followed by an
emergency declaration for the

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.400
State of Minnesota.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.233
And we are also keeping close
watch on the situation in South

00:00:57.233 --> 00:00:59.433
Dakota as it develops.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.567
The Department of Homeland
Security and the Federal

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:04.233
Emergency Management Agency
continue to coordinate the

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:05.767
federal response.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.867
Homeland Security Secretary
Janet Napolitano is helping to

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.100
oversee federal efforts and she
remains in close contact with

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.567
state officials.

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.667
Acting FEMA administrator Nancy
Ward has been in the region

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.900
since yesterday to meet with
folks on the ground and survey

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.934
the area herself.

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:25.033
In addition, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:28.033
assisting in the emergency construction of levees.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.934
The Coast Guard is aiding in
search and rescue efforts while

00:01:30.934 --> 00:01:33.433
the Department of Defense is
helping to move people and

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:34.767
supplies.

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:37.367
Members of the National Guard
have been activated and are on

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:39.433
the scene as well.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.400
Hospitals and nursing homes in
the area are being evacuated and

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.367
residents in poor health or
with special needs are being

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:48.033
transported to higher ground.

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:50.633
Teams from the Department of
Health and Human Services are

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.200
aiding in this work.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.867
And the Red Cross is in place to
provide shelter and supplies for

00:01:55.867 --> 00:01:57.100
folks in need.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.133
It is also important for
residents in these states to

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.734
remain vigilant in monitoring
reports on flood crests and to

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.767
follow instructions from their
state and local leaders in the

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.734
event that evacuations
become necessary.

00:02:08.734 --> 00:02:11.166
My administration is working
closely with Governors John

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.967
Hoeven, Mike Rounds
and Tim Pawlenty.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.934
And I've been meeting with
Senators Byron Dorgan, Kent

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:21.166
Conrad, and Amy Klobuchar, as
well as Congressmen Earl Pomeroy

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.233
and Collin Peterson,
to pledge my support.

00:02:24.233 --> 00:02:26.900
I will continue to monitor
the situation carefully.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.633
We will do what must be done to
help in concert with state and

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:34.767
local agencies and non-profit
organizations - and volunteers

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:38.100
who are doing so much to
aid the response effort.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.934
For at moments like these, we
are reminded of the power of

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.033
nature to disrupt lives
and endanger communities.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:46.867
But we are also reminded of the
power of individuals to make a

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.266
difference.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:51.600
In the Fargodome, thousands of
people gathered not to watch a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.400
football game or a rodeo,
but to fill sandbags.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.800
Volunteers filled 2.5 million of
them in just five days, working

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.600
against the clock, day and
night, with tired arms and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.233
aching backs.

00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:06.967
Others braved freezing
temperatures, gusting winds, and

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:10.667
falling snow to build levees
along the river's banks to help

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:14.600
protect against waters that
have exceeded record levels.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.734
College students have traveled
by the busload from nearby

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:21.033
campuses to lend a hand
during their spring breaks.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.934
Students from local high schools
asked if they could take time to

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:25.400
participate.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.667
Young people have turned
social networks into community

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:31.333
networks, coordinating with one
another online to figure out how

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.834
best to help.

00:03:32.834 --> 00:03:35.700
In the face of an incredible
challenge, the people of these

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.867
communities have rallied
in support of one another.

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:42.834
And their service isn't just
inspirational - it's integral to

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:44.467
our response.

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.266
It's also a reminder of what we
can achieve when Americans come

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.567
together to serve
their communities.

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:52.900
Across the nation, there are
men, women and young people who

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.900
have answered that call, and
millions of others who would

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.133
like to.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.133
Whether it's helping to reduce
the energy we use, cleaning up a

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:03.667
neighborhood park, tutoring in a
local school, or volunteering in

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:07.600
countless other ways, individual
citizens can make a big

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.033
difference.

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:12.000
That is why I'm so happy that
legislation passed the Senate

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.166
this week and the House
last week to provide more

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:18.133
opportunities for Americans to
serve their communities and the

00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:19.467
country.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.266
The bipartisan Senate bill was
sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:26.900
and Senator Ted Kennedy,
leaders who embodies the spirit

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.667
of public service, and I am
looking forward to signing this

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.600
important measure into law.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.467
In facing sudden crises or more
stubborn challenges, the truth

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:39.600
is we are all in this together
- as neighbors and fellow

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.967
citizens.

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:44.033
That is what brought so many
to help in North Dakota and

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.700
Minnesota and other areas
affected by this flooding.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.233
That is what draws people to
volunteer in so many ways,

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:53.934
serving our country here
and on distant shores.

00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:57.767
Our thanks go to them today, and
to all who are working day and

00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:59.900
night to deal with the disaster.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.367
We send them our thoughts, our
prayers, and our continued

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.667
assistance in this
difficult time.

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:06.800
Thank you.
