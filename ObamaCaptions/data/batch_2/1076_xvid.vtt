00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:08.400
The President:
Over the past two years, more than seven million Americans

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.066
have lost their jobs.

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.300
Countless businesses have been
forced to shut their doors.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.600
Few families have escaped the
pain of this terrible recession.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.667
And rarely does a day go by that I don't hear from folks who are hurt.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.433
That's why we have pushed so
hard to rebuild this economy.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.934
But even as we work tirelessly
to dig our way out of this hole,

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.467
it's important that we address
what led us into such a deep

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.700
mess in the first place.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.033
Much of the turmoil of this
recession was caused by the

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:40.033
irresponsibility of banks and
financial institutions on Wall Street.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.633
These financial firms took huge,
reckless risks in pursuit of

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.900
short-term profits
and soaring bonuses.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.800
They gambled with
borrowed money,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.100
without enough oversight or
regard for the consequences.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800
And when they lost,
they lost big.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.600
Little more than a year ago,
many of the largest and oldest

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.834
financial firms in the world
teetered on the brink of

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.934
collapse, overwhelmed by
the consequences of their

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:06.133
irresponsible decisions.

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:09.700
This financial crisis nearly
pulled the entire economy into a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.433
second Great Depression.

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.400
As a result, the
American people --

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.600
struggling in their own right -- were placed in a deeply unfair

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.900
and unsatisfying position.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.033
Even though these financial
firms were largely facing a

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:24.500
crisis of their own making, their failure could've led to an

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.867
even greater calamity for
the country as a whole.

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.734
And that's why the previous
administration started a program

00:01:30.734 --> 00:01:33.867
-- the Troubled Asset
Relief Program, or TARP --

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:36.900
to provide these financial
institutions with funds to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.166
survive the turmoil that
they had helped unleash.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:44.266
It was a distasteful but
necessary thing to do.

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:48.467
Now, many originally feared that
most of the $700 billion in TARP

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:51.100
money would be lost forever.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.266
But when my administration
came into office,

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.233
we put in place rigorous
rules for accountability and

00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.867
transparency, which cut
the costs of the bailout dramatically.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:04.266
We've now recovered most of the money we provided to the banks.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.700
That's good news, but
as far as I'm concerned,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.567
it's not good enough.

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:12.200
We want the taxpayers'
money back -- all of it --

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.700
and we're going to
collect every dime.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.667
That's why, this week, I
proposed a new fee on major

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:20.734
financial firms to compensate
the American people for the

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:24.834
extraordinary assistance they
provided to the financial industry.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:29.533
And the fee would be in place
until the American taxpayer is made whole.

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:33.033
Only the largest financial firms
with more than $50 billion in

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:36.734
assets will be affected,
not community banks.

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:39.567
And the bigger the firm --
and the more debt it holds --

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.333
the larger the fee.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.400
Because we are not only going to
recover our money and help close

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.233
our deficits; we are going
to attack some of the banking

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.500
practices that
led to the crisis.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.967
That's important.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:55.900
The fact is, financial firms
play an essential role in our economy.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.200
They provide capital and credit
to families purchasing homes,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.533
students attending college,
businesses looking to start up

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:03.934
or expand.

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:06.300
That's critical
to our recovery.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.266
That's why our goal
with this fee --

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:11.300
and with the common-sense
financial reforms we seek --

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.800
is not to punish the
financial industry.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.333
Our goal is to prevent the abuse
and excess that nearly led to

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.100
its collapse.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.867
Our goal is to promote fair
dealings while punishing those

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:25.567
who game the system; to
encourage sustained growth while

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:30.166
discouraging the speculative
bubbles that inevitably burst.

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.667
Ultimately, that's in the
shared interest of the financial

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:35.400
industry and the
American people.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.367
And of course, I would like the
banks to embrace this sense of

00:03:38.367 --> 00:03:40.333
mutual responsibility.

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:44.400
So far, though, they have
ferociously fought financial reform.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.867
The industry has even joined
forces with the opposition party

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:50.700
to launch a massive lobbying
campaign against common-sense

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.133
rules to protect consumers
and prevent another crisis.

00:03:55.133 --> 00:03:58.033
Now, like clockwork, the banks
and the politicians who curry

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:02.667
their favor are already trying to stop this fee from going into effect.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:06.533
The very same firms reaping
billions of dollars in profits,

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:09.266
and reportedly handing out
more money in bonuses and

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:12.500
compensation than ever
before in history,

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.700
are now pleading poverty.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.333
It's a sight to see.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.834
Those who oppose this fee say
the banks can't afford to pay

00:04:18.834 --> 00:04:22.200
back the American people without
passing on the costs to their

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.467
shareholders and customers.

00:04:24.467 --> 00:04:26.834
But that's hard to believe when
there are reports that Wall

00:04:26.834 --> 00:04:29.700
Street is going to hand out
more money in bonuses and

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.700
compensation just this year than
the cost of this fee over the

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.600
next ten years.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.200
If the big financial firms
can afford massive bonuses,

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.333
they can afford to pay
back the American people.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.000
Those who oppose this fee have
also had the audacity to suggest

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.066
that it's somehow unfair.

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:49.333
That because these firms have
already returned what they

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:53.166
borrowed directly, their
obligation is fulfilled.

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:56.200
But this willfully ignores the
fact that the entire industry

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.567
benefited not only
from the bailout,

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:02.800
but from the assistance extended to AIG and to homeowners,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.066
and from the many unprecedented
emergency actions taken by the

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:11.834
Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and
others to prevent a financial collapse.

00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:15.500
And it ignores a far greater
unfairness: sticking the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.433
American taxpayer with the bill.

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:22.066
That's unacceptable to me,
and to the American people.

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:25.567
We are not going to let Wall
Street take the money and run.

00:05:25.567 --> 00:05:27.767
We're going to pass
this fee into law.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:30.133
And I'm going to continue
to work with Congress on

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:33.400
common-sense financial reforms
to protect people and the

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.500
economy from the kind of costly
and painful crisis we've just been through.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.667
Because after a very
tough two years,

00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:43.867
after a crisis that has
caused so much havoc,

00:05:43.867 --> 00:05:46.100
if there is one lesson
that we can learn,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.533
it's this: we cannot return
to business as usual.

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:51.867
Thanks very much.
