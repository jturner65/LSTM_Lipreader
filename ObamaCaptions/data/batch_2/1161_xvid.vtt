00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.367
The President:
Over the better part
of the past year,

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:10.066
a great debate has taken
place in Washington and across

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:13.800
America, about how to reform our
health care system to provide

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.000
security for people
with insurance,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.066
coverage for those
without insurance,

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:20.300
and lower costs for everyone.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.467
From the halls of Congress to
the homes of ordinary Americans,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.700
this debate has helped us to
forge consensus and find common ground.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.967
That's a good thing.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.166
That's what America's all about.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:33.633
Now, as the debate
draws to a close,

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:36.767
we can point to a broad and
growing coalition of doctors and

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:40.900
nurses, workers and businesses,
hospitals and even drug

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.000
companies -- folks who
represent different parties and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.300
perspectives, including leading Democrats and many leading

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.100
Republicans -- who recognize
the urgency of action.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.600
Just this week, the Senate
Finance Committee approved a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.066
reform proposal that has both
Democratic and Republican support.

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:01.000
For the first time ever, all
five committees in Congress

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.500
responsible for health reform
have passed a version of legislation.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
As I speak to you today, we are
closer to reforming the health

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.967
care system than we have
ever been in history.

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:14.867
But this is not the time to
pat ourselves on the back.

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.066
This is not the time
to grow complacent.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.667
There are still significant
details and disagreements to be

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.734
worked out in the coming weeks.

00:01:21.734 --> 00:01:25.600
And there are still those who
would try to kill reform at any cost.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.333
The history is clear: for
decades rising health care costs

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.000
have unleashed havoc on
families, businesses,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.567
and the economy.

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.967
And for decades, whenever we
have tried to reform the system,

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.800
the insurance companies have
done everything in their

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.433
considerable power to stop us.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.367
We know that this inaction
has carried a terrible toll.

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.834
In the past decade,
premiums have doubled.

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.266
Over the past few years, total
out of pocket costs for people

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:52.000
with insurance rose by a third.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.900
And we know that if we
do not reform the system,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.800
this will only be a preview
of coming attractions.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.900
A new report for the
Business Roundtable --

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.400
a non-partisan group that
represents the CEOs of major

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.500
companies -- found that
without significant reform,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.367
health care costs for these
employers and their employees

00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:13.500
will well more than double
again over the next decade.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.633
The cost per person for health
insurance will rise by about $18,000.

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:20.266
That's a huge amount of money.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.100
That's going to mean
lower salaries and higher

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.567
unemployment, lower profits
and higher rolls of uninsured.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.533
It's no exaggeration to
say, that unless we act,

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:33.100
these costs will
devastate the US economy.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.333
This is the unsustainable
path we're on,

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:38.333
and it's the path the
insurers want to keep us on.

00:02:38.333 --> 00:02:41.433
In fact, the insurance industry
is rolling out the big guns and

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:43.967
breaking out their
massive war chest --

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:48.300
to marshal their forces for one
last fight to save the status quo.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.400
They're filling the airwaves
with deceptive and dishonest ads.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.967
They're flooding Capitol Hill
with lobbyists and campaign contributions.

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:59.400
And they're funding studies
designed to mislead the American people.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.667
Of course, like clockwork, we've
seen folks on cable television

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.467
who know better, waving these
industry-funded studies in the air.

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:09.300
We've seen industry insiders
-- and their apologists --

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.166
citing these studies as proof
of claims that just aren't true.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:15.633
They'll claim the premiums
will go up under reform;

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.900
but they know that the
non-partisan Congressional

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.367
Budget Office found that reforms
will lower premiums in a new

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.867
insurance exchange while
offering consumer protections

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.667
that will limit out-of-pocket
costs and prevent discrimination

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.767
based on pre-existing
conditions.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:32.233
They'll claim that you'll have
to pay more out of pocket;

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:35.233
but they know that this is
based on a study that willfully

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.433
ignores whole
sections of the bill,

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:40.200
including tax credits and
cost savings that will greatly

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.533
benefit middle class families.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:44.800
Even the authors of one of
these studies have now admitted

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.633
publicly that the insurance
companies actually asked them to

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.633
do an incomplete job.

00:03:50.633 --> 00:03:52.166
It's smoke and mirrors.

00:03:52.166 --> 00:03:53.300
It's bogus.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.100
And it's all too familiar.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.467
Every time we get close
to passing reform,

00:03:57.467 --> 00:03:59.934
the insurance companies produce
these phony studies as a

00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:02.233
prescription and say,
"Take one of these,

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:04.200
and call us in a decade."

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.533
Well, not this time.

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.834
The fact is, the insurance
industry is making this

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:13.033
last-ditch effort to stop reform
even as costs continue to rise

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.266
and our health care dollars
continue to be poured into their

00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:18.467
profits, bonuses, and
administrative costs that do

00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:21.700
nothing to make us healthy -- that often actually go toward

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.400
figuring out how to
avoid covering people.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.700
And they're earning these
profits and bonuses while

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.333
enjoying a privileged exception
from our anti-trust laws,

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:33.266
a matter that Congress
is rightfully reviewing.

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.967
Now, I welcome a good debate.

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:38.700
I welcome the chance to defend
our proposals and to test our

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.633
ideas in the fires
of this democracy.

00:04:41.633 --> 00:04:44.700
But what I will not abide are
those who would bend the truth

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.834
-- or break it -- to score political points and stop our

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:49.767
progress as a country.

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:52.433
And what we all must oppose are
the same old cynical Washington

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:55.500
games that have been played for
decades even as our problems

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.467
have grown and our
challenges have mounted.

00:04:58.467 --> 00:05:01.266
Last November, the American
people went to the polls in

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.000
historic numbers
and demanded change.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.200
They wanted a change
in our policies;

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.333
but they also sought a change
in our politics: a politics that

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:13.333
too often has fallen prey to the lobbyists and special interests;

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:16.567
that's fostered division and sustained the status quo.

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:21.433
Passing health insurance
reform is a great test of this proposition.

00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:24.567
Yes, it will make a profound and
positive difference in the lives

00:05:24.567 --> 00:05:26.200
of the American people.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.433
But it also now represents
something more: whether or not

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:32.667
we as a nation are capable
of tackling our toughest

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:36.567
challenges, if we can serve the
national interest despite the

00:05:36.567 --> 00:05:39.467
unrelenting efforts of
the special interests;

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:42.467
if we can still do
big things in America.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.967
I believe we can.

00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:45.367
I believe we will.

00:05:45.367 --> 00:05:48.000
And I urge every member of
Congress to stand against the

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.367
power plays and
political ploys --

00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:53.767
and to stand up on behalf the
American people who sent us to

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.367
Washington to do their business.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:57.533
Thanks.
