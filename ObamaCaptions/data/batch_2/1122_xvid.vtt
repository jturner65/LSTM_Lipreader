00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.767
The President:
Hello and Happy Fourth
of July, everybody.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.333
This weekend is a time to
get together with family and

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.133
friends, kick back, and
enjoy a little time off.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.900
And I hope that's exactly
what all of you do.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.133
But I also want to take a moment
today to reflect on what I

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:25.867
believe is the meaning of this
distinctly American holiday.

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:28.867
Today, we're called to remember
not only the day our country was

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:33.000
born -- we're also called to remember the indomitable spirit

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.033
of the first American citizens
who made that day possible.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.767
We're called to remember
how unlikely it was that our

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:42.166
American experiment
would succeed at all;

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.767
that a small band of patriots
would declare independence from

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:50.500
a powerful empire; and that they
would form, in the new world,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.800
what the old world
had never known --

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.567
a government of, by,
and for the people.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:01:00.400
That unyielding spirit is
what defines us as Americans.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.500
It's what led generations of
pioneers to blaze a Western trail.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.266
It's what led my grandparents'
generation to persevere in the

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.600
face of a Depression and
triumph in the face of tyranny.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200
It's what led generations of
American workers to build an

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.066
industrial economy
unrivalled around the world.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:20.667
It's what has always
led us, as a people,

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.700
not to wilt or cower
at a difficult moment,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.266
but to face down any trial
and rise to any challenge,

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:32.133
understanding that each of us
has a hand in writing America's destiny.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.600
That is the spirit we are
called to show once more.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.333
We're facing an array of
challenges on a scale unseen in our time.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.967
We're waging two wars.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.100
We're battling
a deep recession.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.667
And our economy -- and
our nation itself --

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:49.500
are endangered by festering
problems we've kicked down the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.667
road for far too long:
spiraling health care costs;

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:57.500
inadequate schools; and a
dependence on foreign oil.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.667
Meeting these extraordinary
challenges will require an

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.667
extraordinary effort on
the part of every American.

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:05.734
And that's an effort we
cannot defer any longer.

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:10.633
Now is the time to lay a new
foundation for growth and prosperity.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:13.233
Now's the time to revamp
our education system,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:16.533
demand more from our teachers,
parents, and students alike,

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.767
and build schools that prepare
every child in America to

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:22.800
outcompete any
worker in the world.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.500
Now is the time to reform an
unsustainable health care system

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.133
that's imposing crushing
costs on families, businesses,

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.567
large and small, as well as
state and federal budgets.

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:35.200
We need to protect what
works, fix what's broken,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.834
and bring down costs
for all Americans.

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:38.834
No more talk.

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:40.066
No more delay.

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.767
Health care reform
must happen this year.

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:45.667
And now is the time to meet
our energy challenge --

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.166
one of the greatest challenges
we've ever confronted as a

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.367
people or as a planet.

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:52.867
For the sake of our
economy and our children,

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.633
we must build on the historic
bill passed by the House of

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.967
Representatives, and make clean
energy the profitable kind of

00:02:58.967 --> 00:03:01.967
energy so that we can end our
dependence on foreign oil and

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:04.333
reclaim America's future.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.233
These are some of the challenges
that our generation has been

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.900
called to meet.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.834
And yet, there are those who
would have us try what's

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:13.367
already failed; who would
defend the status quo.

00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:16.633
They argue that our health care
system is fine the way it is and

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.200
that a clean energy
economy can wait.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.233
They say we're
trying to do too much,

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:24.100
that we're moving too quickly,
and that we all ought to just

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.633
take a deep breath and
scale back our goals.

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:30.333
These naysayers
have short memories.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.367
They forget that
we, as a people,

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:37.000
did not get here by standing
pat in a time of change.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.367
We didn't get here by
doing what was easy.

00:03:39.367 --> 00:03:42.133
That's not how a cluster of
13 colonies became the United

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:44.333
States of America.

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:46.734
We're not a people
who fear the future.

00:03:46.734 --> 00:03:48.500
We're a people who make it.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.767
And on this July 4th, we need to
summon that spirit once more.

00:03:52.767 --> 00:03:55.367
We need to summon the same
spirit that inhabited

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.967
Independence Hall two hundred
and thirty-three years ago today.

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.500
That's how this generation of
Americans will make its mark on history.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.300
That's how we will make the
most of this extraordinary moment.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.967
And that's how we will write
the next great chapter in the

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:10.900
great American story.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.433
Thank you, and happy
Fourth of July.
