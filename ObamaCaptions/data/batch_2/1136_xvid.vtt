00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:10.667
The President:
This week, I nominated Judge
Sonia Sotomayor of the U.S.

00:00:10.667 --> 00:00:13.600
Court of Appeals to replace
Justice David Souter,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.767
who's retiring after nearly two
decades on the Supreme Court.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.967
After reviewing many
terrific candidates,

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:22.567
I am certain that
she's the right choice.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:25.867
In fact, there has not been a
nominee in several generations

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:29.433
who's brought the depth of
judicial experience to this job

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:31.033
that she offers.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.066
Judge Sotomayor's career began
when she served as an Assistant

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:37.433
District Attorney in New York,
prosecuting violent crimes in

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.567
America's largest city.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:42.700
After leaving the DA's office,
she became a litigator,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
representing clients in complex
international legal disputes.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.533
She was appointed to
the U.S. District Court,

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:51.800
serving six years as a trial judge where she presided over

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.433
hundreds of cases.

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:56.400
And most recently, she has
spent eleven years on the U.S.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.867
Court of Appeals, our nation's
second highest court,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:02.767
grappling with some of the most
difficult constitutional and

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:05.400
legal issues we
face as a nation.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.166
She has more experience on the
federal bench than any incoming

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:12.500
Supreme Court Justice in
the past hundred years.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.100
Quite simply, Judge Sotomayor
has a deep familiarity with our

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.133
judicial system from
almost every angle.

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.967
And her achievements are all
the more impressive when you

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:24.467
consider what she had to
overcome in order to achieve them.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.767
Judge Sotomayor grew up in a
housing project in the South

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:30.633
Bronx; her parents came to New
York from Puerto Rico during the

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.467
Second World War.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:35.767
Her father was a factory worker
with a third grade education;

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.100
and when she was just nine
years old, he passed away.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.433
Her mother worked six days a
week as a nurse to provide for

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.633
her and her brother, buying the
only set of encyclopedias in the

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:49.200
neighborhood and sending her
children to Catholic school.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.166
That's what had made it possible
for Judge Sotomayor to attend

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.467
two of America's
leading universities,

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.367
graduating at the top of her
class at Princeton University,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.600
and studying at Yale Law School
where she won a prestigious post

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.433
as an editor of the
school's Law Journal.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:06.967
These many years later, it was
hard not to be moved by Judge

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:09.900
Sotomayor's mother, sitting
in the front row at the White

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.633
House, her eyes
welling with tears,

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.033
as her daughter --
who had come so far,

00:02:15.033 --> 00:02:18.734
for whom she had sacrificed so
much -- was nominated to the

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.200
highest court in the land.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.533
This is what makes Judge
Sotomayor so extraordinary.

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.066
Even as she has reached the
heights of her profession,

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.934
she's never forgotten
where she began.

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.967
She's faced down barriers,
overcome difficult odds,

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.300
and lived the American dream.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.133
As a Justice of
the Supreme Court,

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:39.533
she will bring not only the
experience acquired over the

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.000
course of a brilliant
legal career,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.433
but the wisdom accumulated over
the course of an extraordinary

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:50.066
journey -- a journey defined by
hard work, fierce intelligence,

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:52.800
and that enduring
faith that, in America,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.200
all things are possible.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.600
It's her experience in life and
her achievements in the legal

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.433
profession that have earned
Judge Sotomayor respect across

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:04.467
party lines and
ideological divides.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.500
She was originally named to the U.S. District Court by the first

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.200
President Bush, a Republican.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.834
She was appointed to the federal
Court of Appeals by President

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:15.133
Clinton, a Democrat.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.934
She twice has been overwhelmingly confirmed by the

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:19.266
U.S. Senate.

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.767
And I am gratified by the
support for this nomination

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.767
voiced by members of the legal
community who represent views

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:28.400
from across the
political spectrum.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.300
There are, of course, some in
Washington who are attempting to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.433
draw old battle lines and
playing the usual political

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:37.900
games, pulling a few comments
out of context to paint a

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.300
distorted picture of
Judge Sotomayor's record.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.633
But I am confident that
these efforts will fail;

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:47.433
because Judge Sotomayor's
17-year record on the bench --

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:50.934
hundreds of judicial decisions
that every American can read for

00:03:50.934 --> 00:03:54.967
him or herself -- speak
far louder than any attack;

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.467
her record makes clear
that she is fair, unbiased,

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:01.100
and dedicated to
the rule of law.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.600
As a fellow judge on her court,
appointed by Ronald Reagan,

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.767
said recently, "I don't think
I'd go as far as to classify her

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.800
in one camp or another.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.033
I think she just deserves the
classification of outstanding judge."

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.633
Congress returns this week and
I hope the confirmation process

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.967
will begin without delay.

00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:24.200
No nominee should be seated
without rigorous evaluation and

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.767
hearing; I expect nothing less.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:30.233
But what I hope is that we can
avoid the political posturing

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:33.066
and ideological brinksmanship
that has bogged down this

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:36.300
process -- and Congress
-- in the past.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.533
Judge Sotomayor ought to be on
the bench when the Supreme Court

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.467
decides what cases to hear
this year and I'm calling on

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:46.700
Democrats and Republicans to
be thorough -- and timely -- in

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.633
dealing with this nomination.

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:51.400
As President, there are few
responsibilities more serious or

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.867
consequential than the naming
of a Supreme Court Justice.

00:04:54.867 --> 00:04:58.033
The members of our highest
court are granted life tenure.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.834
They're charged with applying
principles put to paper more

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:04.033
than two centuries ago to some
of the most difficult questions

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:05.767
of our time.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:08.200
And the impact of their
decisions extend beyond an

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.967
administration, but for
generations to come.

00:05:11.967 --> 00:05:15.200
This is a decision that I've not
taken lightly and it's one that

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.133
I am proud to have made.

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:21.500
I know that Justice Sotomayor
will serve this nation with distinction.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.000
And when she ascends those
marble steps to assume her seat

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.834
on the Supreme Court, bringing
a lifetime of experience on and

00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:32.633
off the bench, America will have
taken another important step

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:36.700
towards realizing the ideal that
is chiseled above its entrance:

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.600
Equal justice under the law.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.667
Thanks.
