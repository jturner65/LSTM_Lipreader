00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.166
This morning I'd like to
talk about some good news

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:14.016
and some bad news as we
confront our economic crisis.

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:17.716
The bad news is well known to
Americans across our country

00:00:18.286 --> 00:00:19.606
as we continue to struggle

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:21.566
through unprecedented
economic turmoil.

00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:24.806
Yesterday we learned
that our economy shrank

00:00:24.986 --> 00:00:27.886
by nearly 4 percent from
October through December.

00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:31.746
That decline was the largest
in over a quarter century,

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:34.006
and it underscores
the seriousness

00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:36.756
of the economic crisis that
my administration found

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:37.736
when we took office.

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:41.496
Already the slowdown has
cost us tens of thousands

00:00:41.496 --> 00:00:42.816
of jobs in January alone.

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:44.606
And the picture is likely

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:46.236
to get worse before
it gets better.

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:49.076
Make no mistake, these
are not just numbers.

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:51.786
Behind every statistic
there's a story.

00:00:52.686 --> 00:00:55.036
Many Americans have seen their
lives turned upside down.

00:00:55.986 --> 00:00:58.436
Families have been forced
to make painful choices.

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:00.646
Parents are struggling
to pay the bills.

00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:02.506
Patients can't afford care.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.876
Students can't keep
pace with tuition.

00:01:05.226 --> 00:01:07.636
And workers don't know whether
their retirement will be

00:01:07.636 --> 00:01:08.836
dignified and secure.

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:13.156
The good news is that we are
moving forward with a sense

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.996
of urgency equal
to the challenge.

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:18.416
This week the House passed
the American Recovery

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.346
and Reinvestment Plan, which
will save or create more

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:24.106
than 3 million jobs
over the next few years.

00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:27.116
It puts a tax cut into the
pockets of working families,

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:31.156
and places a down payment on
America's future by investing

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.936
in energy independence
and education,

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:36.076
affordable health care, and
American infrastructure.

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:39.796
Now this recovery plan
moves to the Senate.

00:01:40.456 --> 00:01:43.196
I will continue working
with both parties

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.136
so that the strongest
possible bill gets to my desk.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.366
With the stakes so high we
simply cannot afford the same

00:01:50.366 --> 00:01:53.236
old gridlock and partisan
posturing in Washington.

00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:55.776
It's time to move
in a new direction.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:58.756
Americans know that our
economic recovery will take

00:01:58.756 --> 00:02:00.076
years -- not months.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.806
But they will have little
patience if we allow politics

00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:04.866
to get in the way of action,

00:02:05.356 --> 00:02:07.026
and our economy
continues to slide.

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.996
That's why I am calling on
the Senate to pass this plan,

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:14.656
so that we can put people back
to work and begin the long,

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:17.466
hard work of lifting our
economy out of this crisis.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:21.116
No one bill, no matter
how comprehensive,

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.986
can cure what ails our economy.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:27.556
So just as we jumpstart job
creation, we must also ensure

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:29.916
that markets are stable,
credit is flowing,

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.166
and families can
stay in their homes.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:34.836
Last year Congress
passed a plan

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:36.206
to rescue the financial system.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.716
While the package helped
avoid a financial collapse,

00:02:40.196 --> 00:02:43.116
many are frustrated by the
results -- and rightfully so.

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.036
Too often taxpayer
dollars have been spent

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.056
without transparency
or accountability.

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:52.046
Banks have been extended a
hand, but homeowners, students,

00:02:52.306 --> 00:02:54.516
and small businesses that
need loans have been left

00:02:54.516 --> 00:02:55.506
to fend on their own.

00:02:56.336 --> 00:03:00.336
And adding to this outrage,
we learned this week that even

00:03:00.336 --> 00:03:02.766
as they petitioned for
taxpayer assistance,

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.396
Wall Street firms
shamefully paid

00:03:05.396 --> 00:03:09.496
out nearly $20 billion
in bonuses for 2008.

00:03:10.556 --> 00:03:12.096
While I'm committed
to doing what it takes

00:03:12.096 --> 00:03:13.376
to maintain the flow of credit,

00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:16.696
the American people will
not excuse or tolerate

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.486
such arrogance and greed.

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:22.266
The road to recovery demands
that we all act responsibly,

00:03:22.606 --> 00:03:25.936
from Main Street to
Washington to Wall Street.

00:03:26.616 --> 00:03:29.136
Soon my Treasury
Secretary, Tim Geithner,

00:03:29.236 --> 00:03:30.766
will announce a new strategy

00:03:30.896 --> 00:03:33.786
for reviving our financial
system that gets credit flowing

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:35.266
to businesses and families.

00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:38.246
We'll help lower mortgage
costs and extend loans

00:03:38.246 --> 00:03:40.776
to small businesses so
they can create jobs.

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:43.836
We'll ensure that CEOs
are not draining funds

00:03:43.836 --> 00:03:45.516
that should be advancing
our recovery.

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:49.376
And we will insist on
unprecedented transparency,

00:03:49.736 --> 00:03:52.436
rigorous oversight, and
clear accountability --

00:03:52.746 --> 00:03:55.046
so taxpayers know how
their money is being spent

00:03:55.456 --> 00:03:57.316
and whether it is
achieving results.

00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:01.576
Rarely in history has our
country faced economic problems

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:03.316
as devastating as this crisis.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:04.546
But the strength

00:04:04.546 --> 00:04:06.876
of the American people
compels us to come together.

00:04:07.836 --> 00:04:10.686
The road ahead will be
long, but I promise you

00:04:10.686 --> 00:04:14.076
that every day that I go to
work in the Oval Office I carry

00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:17.886
with me your stories, and my
administration is dedicated

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:21.206
to alleviating your struggles
and advancing your dreams.

00:04:21.816 --> 00:04:23.006
You are calling for action.

00:04:23.836 --> 00:04:26.576
Now is the time for those
of us in Washington to live

00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.416
up to our responsibilities.
