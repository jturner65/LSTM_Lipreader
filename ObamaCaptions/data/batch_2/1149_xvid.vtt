00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.700
The President:
All across America are good, decent folks who meet their

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.000
obligations each and every day.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.233
They work hard.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.834
They support their families.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.333
They try to make an honest
living the best they can.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.967
And this weekend, many are
sitting down to pay the taxes

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:21.033
they owe -- not
because it's fun,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:25.333
but because it's a fundamental responsibility of our citizenship.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.233
But in tough times, when many
families are having trouble just

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.934
making it all work, Tax Day
can seem even more daunting.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:35.567
This year, however, many
Americans are seeing some

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.100
welcome relief.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.567
So far, Americans who have filed
their taxes have discovered that

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:43.200
the average refund is up
nearly 10% this year --

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.300
to an all-time high
of about $3,000.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.800
This is due in large
part to the Recovery Act.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.633
In fact, one-third of the
Recovery Act was made up of tax

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:54.667
cuts -- tax cuts that have already provided more than

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:59.300
$160 billion in relief for families and businesses,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.133
and nearly $100 billion of that
goes directly into the pockets

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.300
of working Americans.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.433
No one I've met is
looking for a handout.

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:09.400
And that's not what
these tax cuts are.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.400
Instead, they're targeted relief
to help middle class families

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.467
weather the storm, to
jumpstart our economy,

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:18.166
and to bring the fundamentals
of the American Dream --

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:21.633
making an honest living, earning
an education, owning a home,

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:26.734
and raising a family -- back within reach for millions of Americans.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:29.500
First, because folks who work
hard should be able to make a

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.734
decent living, I kept a promise
I made when I campaigned for

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:37.767
this office and cut taxes for
95% of working Americans.

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.033
For most Americans, this Making
Work Pay tax credit began

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.500
showing up in your
paychecks last April.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.233
And it continues this year, for
a total of $400 per individual

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.200
and $800 per couple, per year.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.900
Second, because a college
education is critical to the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.567
success of our workers
and our economy,

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.767
we're helping to make it more
affordable for millions of Americans.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:02.800
Millions of students and parents
paying for college tuition are

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.233
now eligible for up to $2,500
under the American Opportunity Credit.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:10.300
Along with a host of
other steps we've taken,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.133
this will help us reach our goal
of once again having the highest

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:17.500
proportion of college graduates
in the world by 2020.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.433
Third, we're restoring the home
as a source of stability and an

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:22.600
anchor of the American Dream.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.734
If you've bought a home
for the first time,

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:27.834
you're eligible for a
credit of up to $8,000.

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:30.000
And if you bought a
new car last year,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.166
you can deduct the state and local sales taxes you paid on that car.

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.900
Fourth, whether you bought a
home for the first time or

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.700
you've owned one
for a long time,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.433
if you invested in making your
home more energy-efficient with

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.600
certain improvements like
new insulation or windows,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.400
or you plan to this year, you're eligible for up to $1,500 in new

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.834
tax credits.

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:53.533
This does more than just put
money back in your pocket;

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:56.767
it's helping create new
clean energy, manufacturing,

00:02:56.767 --> 00:03:00.700
and construction jobs at small
businesses across the country.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.567
Fifth, to help working families
with children through difficult

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:07.233
times, we increased the Earned
Income Tax Credit and allowed

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:10.767
more families to qualify
for the Child Tax Credit.

00:03:10.767 --> 00:03:13.233
Finally, for those who lost
their jobs in the recession and

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.133
need some help getting
back on their feet,

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.834
we provided a 65% tax credit to
help cover the cost of health

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:23.734
care and we made sure the first $2,400 in unemployment benefits

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:25.400
is tax-free.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.734
These are among the tax breaks
and savings that are available

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:30.967
to over one hundred million
Americans right now.

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:33.633
It's also important to note
that the new health reform law

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:36.100
includes the largest middle
class tax cut for health care in

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.300
history, and once
it's implemented;

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.600
millions of Americans will
finally be able to purchase

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.367
quality, affordable care and the
security and peace of mind that

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:45.633
comes with it.

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:48.633
And one thing we have not
done is raise income taxes on

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.800
families making less
than $250,000 a year.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.166
That's another promise
that we've kept.

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:59.300
We've also made it easy to find
out what's owed to you and your family.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.934
After all, the big guys know
how to find their tax breaks;

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.500
it's time you did, too.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.200
Just visit whitehouse.gov and
click on the Tax Savings Tool.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.400
It's already been accessed more than 100,000 times by folks who

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.667
want to see what savings they're owed and how to collect them.

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:16.533
If you've already filed your
taxes and missed some of the

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:18.967
savings available to
you, don't worry --

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:22.400
you can still amend your returns
after April 15th to save

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.233
hundreds or even
thousands of dollars.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:29.066
And just as each of us meet our
responsibilities as citizens,

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.633
we expect our businesses and our
government to meet theirs in return.

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.767
That's why I've asked Congress
to close some of the biggest tax

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:38.834
loopholes exploited by some of
our most profitable corporations

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:40.834
to avoid paying
their fair share --

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:43.367
or, in some cases,
paying taxes at all.

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.734
That's why we're tightening
Washington's belt by cutting

00:04:45.734 --> 00:04:49.000
programs that don't work, and
contracts that aren't fair,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.767
and spending we don't need.

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:53.500
And that's why I've proposed
a freeze on discretionary

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.467
spending, signed the law that
restores the pay-as-you-go

00:04:56.467 --> 00:04:59.700
principle that helped produce
the surpluses of the 1990s,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.000
and created a bipartisan,
independent commission to help

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.033
solve our fiscal crisis and
close the deficits that have

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:08.166
been growing for a decade.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.633
Because I refuse to leave our
problems to the next generation.

00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:13.900
It's been a tough couple
years for America.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.734
But the economy's growing again.

00:05:15.734 --> 00:05:17.867
Companies are beginning
to hire again.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.367
We are rewarding work and
helping more of our people reach

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.400
for the American Dream again.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.200
And while there's no doubt
we still face a long journey

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.967
together, with
more steps to take,

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:29.934
more obstacles to overcome, and
more challenges to face along

00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:33.600
the way; if there's one thing
on which the people of this

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.834
great country have convinced me,
it's that the United States of

00:05:36.834 --> 00:05:40.633
America will recover,
stronger than before.

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:43.133
Thanks for listening,
and have a great weekend.
