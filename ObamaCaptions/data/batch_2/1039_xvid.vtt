The President:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.367
Today, I want to take a break
from the back-and-forth of

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.266
campaign season and talk about
something that's brought us all

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.467
together this week --
the Summer Olympics.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:18.133
These games remind us that
for all our differences,

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:19.767
we're Americans first.

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:22.433
And we could not be prouder of
the men and women representing

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:25.433
our country in London, in
both the Olympics and in

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:27.133
the Paralympics.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.967
Last weekend, Michelle led the
American delegation to London

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.533
and reaffirmed the special
relationship we share with our

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:35.166
strongest ally, Great Britain.

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.633
She met with the Queen, and
with Prime Minister Cameron's

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.133
wife, Samantha.

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:41.834
She spent some time thanking
our brave service members and

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:43.500
military families.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.133
And, of course, she took in
as many events as she could to

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.066
cheer on our athletes.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.400
I've got to admit I was a little
jealous that she got to go.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.300
But like many of you, I caught
as many events as I could,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.367
jumping off the couch for a
close race, or a perfect vault.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.867
I watched the wonderful young
women of our gymnastics team

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:03.233
recapture the team
gold for America,

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.834
and I was filled with pride
watching Gabby Douglas win the

00:01:05.834 --> 00:01:09.333
all-around gold with
incredible poise and grace.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.734
I watched our swimmers
win a haul of medals,

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.700
and Michael Phelps become the
most decorated Olympic athlete

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.266
of all time.

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:19.100
I saw our women's soccer team
power through the competition.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.433
And I'm just as proud of all our
athletes in sports that don't

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.367
always get as much attention.

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.066
The U.S. women's eight continued
its rowing dominance with

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.734
another gold medal.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.934
Kayla Harrison won America's
first-ever gold medal in Judo,

00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:35.266
and Marti Malloy won a bronze.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.300
Kim Rhode became the first
American to win individual

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.433
medals in five straight Olympics
with her gold in skeet shooting;

00:01:42.433 --> 00:01:45.467
and her teammate, Army
Sergeant Vincent Hancock,

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:47.867
won his second skeet gold.

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:50.300
I also thought of the truly
difficult journeys that many of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.100
our athletes have made.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.633
Some have faced personal
loss, or beaten cancer.

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:59.133
Some have worked long shifts
at multiple jobs to feed their

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.867
Olympic dream.

00:02:00.867 --> 00:02:03.433
And some have done
the impossible.

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:06.533
Less than four years ago,
Bryshon Nellum was shot three

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:08.166
times in his legs.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.166
But this week, he'll
run the 400 meters.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:15.433
And as a boy, Lopez Lomong fled
war and persecution and life as

00:02:15.433 --> 00:02:18.900
a refugee -- one of the
"Lost Boys" of Sudan.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.300
Today, he's an American -- and
representing his country at the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.900
Olympics for the second time.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.800
So it's no surprise America
is vying for the top of the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200
medal count.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.266
But it's not the medal count
alone that inspires us --

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:35.367
most of our athletes won't
claim a medal at all.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:38.166
It's the character of the
men and women who compete for

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:39.667
those medals.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.266
It's their hard work
and sacrifice --

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:46.867
the countless hours in the
gym, in the pool, on the track.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:50.600
It's their dogged perseverance
and unyielding determination,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.133
through disappointment
and triumph alike.

00:02:54.133 --> 00:02:58.867
It's that unconquerable spirit
-- that American spirit --

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.533
that says even though we may
have very different stories to

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:05.800
tell; even though we may not all
look alike or talk alike or be

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.600
dealt the same hand in
life -- if we work hard,

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.667
we can achieve our dreams.

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:14.266
We can make it if we try.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.533
We are one people, with
common values and ideals;

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:19.767
we celebrate
individual excellence,

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.800
but recognize that only together
can we accomplish great and

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.433
important things we
cannot accomplish alone.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.033
That's why we watch.

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:29.667
That's why we cheer.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:32.200
That's why we come together,
for two weeks in summer,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.066
and swell with pride at the
incredible things our fellow

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:37.000
citizens can do.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.200
And so, to all our Olympic
and Paralympic athletes --

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.900
whether you've already competed
or have yet to compete --

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.700
your country could
not be prouder of you.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.367
Thank you for presenting the
best of America to the rest

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:49.767
of the world.

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:53.467
And thank you for becoming new
role models to our children --

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:56.633
mine included -- and inspiring
them to believe that if they

00:03:56.633 --> 00:03:59.000
work hard and do their
best, they can achieve

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.700
great things, too.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.667
Go get 'em this week, Team USA.

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.800
We can't wait to
welcome you home.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.166
God bless you, and
God bless America.
