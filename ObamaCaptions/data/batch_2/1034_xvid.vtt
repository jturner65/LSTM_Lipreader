00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:09.700
The President:
One month ago this week, BP's Deepwater Horizon drilling rig

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.000
exploded off Louisiana's coast,
killing 11 people and rupturing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.900
an underwater pipe.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.600
The resulting oil spill has not
only dealt an economic blow to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.166
Americans across the Gulf
Coast, it also represents an

00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:24.533
environmental disaster.

00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:27.800
In response, we're drawing on
America's best minds and using

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.233
the world's best technology
to stop the leak.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:36.100
We've deployed over 1,100
vessels, about 24,000 personnel,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.433
and more than 2 million total
feet of boom to help contain it.

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:43.233
And we're doing all we can to
assist struggling fishermen,

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:47.200
and the small businesses and
communities that depend on them.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.900
Folks on the Gulf Coast
-- and across America --

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.700
are rightly demanding swift
action to clean up BP's mess and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.567
end this ordeal.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.600
But they're also demanding to
know how this happened in the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.333
first place, and how we can make
sure it never happens again.

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:04.767
That's what I'd like to spend
a few minutes talking with you about.

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:07.767
First and foremost, what led to
this disaster was a breakdown of

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.633
responsibility on the part
of BP and perhaps others,

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.800
including Transocean
and Halliburton.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.667
And we will continue to hold the
relevant companies accountable

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:18.500
not only for being forthcoming
and transparent about the facts

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.233
surrounding the leak,
but for shutting it down,

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:24.000
repairing the damage it does,
and repaying Americans who've

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.767
suffered a financial loss.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.367
But even as we continue
to hold BP accountable,

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.000
we also need to hold
Washington accountable.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.066
Now, this catastrophe is
unprecedented in its nature,

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:39.033
and it presents a host of new
challenges we're working to address.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:42.033
But the question is what lessons
we can learn from this disaster

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.533
to make sure it
never happens again.

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:46.900
If the laws on our books are
inadequate to prevent such an

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.500
oil spill, or if we didn't enforce those laws --

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.800
I want to know it.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.467
I want to know what worked and
what didn't work in our response

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:57.500
to the disaster, and where
oversight of the oil and gas

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.734
industry broke down.

00:01:59.734 --> 00:02:02.533
We know, for example, that a
cozy relationship between oil

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:05.266
and gas companies and the agencies that regulate them has

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.700
long been a source of concern.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
Secretary of the Interior Ken
Salazar has taken steps to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.533
address this problem; steps that
build on reforms he has been

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.734
implementing since
he took office.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:18.567
But we need to do a lot more to
protect the health and safety of

00:02:18.567 --> 00:02:21.967
our people; to safeguard the
quality of our air and water;

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.800
and to preserve the natural
beauty and bounty of America.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.967
In recent weeks, we've taken a
number of immediate measures to

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:29.800
prevent another spill.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.467
We've ordered inspections of all
deepwater operations in the Gulf

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:33.967
of Mexico.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:36.800
We've announced that no permits
for drilling new wells will go

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.700
forward until the 30-day safety
and environmental review I

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.734
requested is complete.

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.400
And I've called on Congress to
pass a bill that would provide

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.700
critical funds and tools to
respond to this spill and better

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.900
prepare us to confront
any future spills.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.266
But we also need to take a
comprehensive look at how the

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:58.100
oil and gas industry operates
and how we regulate them.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.633
That's why, on Friday, I signed
an executive order establishing

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.667
the National Commission on the
BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.300
and Offshore Drilling.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.533
While there are a number
of ongoing investigations,

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.000
including an independent review
by the National Academy of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.533
Engineering, the purpose of this
Commission is to consider both

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:19.633
the root causes of the disaster
and offer options on what safety

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.433
and environmental precautions
we need to take to prevent a

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:25.200
similar disaster
from happening again.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.467
This Commission, I'd note, is
similar to one proposed by

00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:30.333
Congresswoman Capps
and Senator Whitehouse.

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:33.066
And I've asked Democrat
Bob Graham and Republican

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:35.533
Bill Reilly to co-chair
this Commission.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:38.000
Bob served two terms
as Florida's governor,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.667
and represented Florida as a
United States Senator for almost

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:42.300
two decades.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.633
During that time, he earned a
reputation as a champion of the

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.533
environment, leading the
most extensive environmental

00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:50.500
protection effort in
the state's history.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.500
Bill Reilly is chairman emeritus
of the board of the World

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.500
Wildlife Fund, and he is also
deeply knowledgeable about the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.300
oil and gas industry.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.934
During the presidency
of George H.W. Bush,

00:04:00.934 --> 00:04:04.166
Bill was Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency,

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:07.734
and his tenure encompassed
the Exxon Valdez disaster.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:10.900
I can't think of two people who
will bring greater experience or

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.266
better judgment to
the task at hand.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:15.767
In the days to come, I'll
appoint 5 other distinguished

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:17.934
Americans --
including scientists,

00:04:17.934 --> 00:04:20.200
engineers, and
environmental advocates --

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.233
to join them on the Commission.

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:25.166
And I'm directing them to
report back in 6 months with

00:04:25.166 --> 00:04:27.367
recommendations on
how we can prevent --

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:30.834
and mitigate the impact of -- any future spills that result

00:04:30.834 --> 00:04:33.100
from offshore drilling.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.166
One of the reasons I ran for
President was to put America on

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:40.300
the path to energy independence,
and I have not wavered from that commitment.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.100
To achieve that goal, we must
pursue clean energy and energy

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.767
efficiency, and we've taken
significant steps to do so.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:51.934
And we must also pursue domestic
sources of oil and gas.

00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:55.066
Because it represents 30%
of our oil production,

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:58.266
the Gulf of Mexico can play an
important part in securing our

00:04:58.266 --> 00:04:59.900
energy future.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.467
But we can only pursue offshore
oil drilling if we have

00:05:02.467 --> 00:05:07.500
assurances that a disaster like
the BP oil spill will not happen again.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.467
This Commission will, I hope,
help provide those assurances so

00:05:10.467 --> 00:05:13.834
we can continue to seek a secure
energy future for the United

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:15.400
States of America.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.533
Thanks so much.
